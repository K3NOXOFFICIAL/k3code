// A desktop notification as evidence.
//
// A harness that wants its user sends a desktop notification: OSC 9 from
// iTerm2's vocabulary, OSC 777 from urxvt's, or OSC 99 from kitty's. Claude
// Code sends "Claude needs your permission to use Bash" that way, and Codex
// sends "Approval requested" before a command and a line of its answer when a
// turn ends. It is the harness speaking about itself on purpose, which makes it
// the same kind of evidence a title is, and it is filed under the same source.
//
// The rules have the shape of title rules and are matched as prose, the way a
// screen is: a notification is a sentence, not a path, so a substring anywhere
// in it counts. The title and the body are read as one text, title first.

// NotifyText joins a notification's title and body into the text the rules
// read.

	case title == "":
		return body
	case body == "":
		return title
	default:
		return title + "\n" + body
	}
