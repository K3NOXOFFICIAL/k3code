// TestBundledScreenRulesPolicy is the policy check, narrowed from
// "nothing ships enabled" and argued for on purpose.
//
// The old rule cost more than it saved. Reading another program's UI is a
// maintenance treadmill, but a harness waiting on a human was measured emitting
// nothing at all: no output, no title, no progress sequence. With rules off, the
// pane goes quiet, the stall timer calls it idle and the alert policy ignores
// idle, so the state a user most needs to be told about was the one state
// nothing could reach. Off-by-default made that unreachable for everyone who had
// not hand-written rules, which is everyone.
//
// What the treadmill actually costs is bounded in the safe direction: a rule
// that rots stops matching, classification returns no opinion, and the pane
// behaves exactly as it did before the rule existed. The expensive direction is a
// rule matching something it should not, so bundled rules carry several strings
// together rather than any one of them.
//
// Working rules ship for every harness that has chrome to key on, so an
// unhooked pane can say it is busy rather than drifting to unknown on the
// silence timer. Idle ships only for the harnesses in screenIdleHarnesses:
// the ones whose idle screen was measured here, or for which herdr ships an
// idle rule from its own live pane reads. Three things keep that honest. An
// idle rule has to prove an input box is on the screen (the loader refuses one
// that does not), every idle rule is outranked by every working and
// needs_input rule of its manifest, so a screen showing the box and a live
// turn at once reads as the louder state, and the daemon holds an idle
// verdict through a confirmation window before it publishes it.
