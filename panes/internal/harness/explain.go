// or was not an agent, with nothing said about which of comm, argv0, argv_path or
// exe_glob decided it, and no way to see what the daemon had actually read. That
// is how a registry where every exe_glob matched nothing shipped, and how a rule
// that matched any process with an agent's name in an argument went unnoticed
// until users reported unrelated panes turning into agents.
