// What is proved here is the reliability of a link that has already worked:
// that an idle one is held open, that a dropped one says why it dropped and
// reads as reconnecting rather than as an offline machine, and that the things
// which are merely slow (a listing, a reader that fell behind) do not end it.
//
// The failure these exist for is a specific one. A session on a cloud host kept
// being taken away from the person using it, and the three causes below all
// presented as the same sentence: "the link closed".

// TestTwoListingsAtOnceDoNotReadEachOthersAnswers is a correctness bug the
// reliability work turned up.
//
// The control stream is one line of request and one of reply with nothing
// pairing them. Two clients polling the rail is enough to put two calls on it
// at once. What came back was not merely one host's answer under another
// host's name: both callers read the same bufio.Reader, and the daemon
// panicked with a slice bounds error inside bufio.ReadSlice, taking every
// session on that machine with it.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL, failed to fail: removing the lock this pins makes the test
// panic rather than report an assertion, because there is no way to run two
// calls on one reader that is merely wrong instead of fatal. The panic is the
// shipped behaviour at 3aebb8da and was reproduced there.
