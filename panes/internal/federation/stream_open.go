// for it, carried in the open frame's payload. The payload used to be empty,
// and an empty payload still decodes to the zero value, so a hub that sends
// nothing and a proxy that reads nothing keep linking exactly as before.
//
// The payload is written by the hub's mux and never by the client whose bytes
// the stream then carries: those go in data frames. So a field here is the
// hub's own statement, which a client on the hub cannot forge by what it
// sends.
