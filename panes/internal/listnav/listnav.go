// Package listnav is the one rule every vertical list in the TUI moves by.
//
// Each list used to carry its own copy of "add delta and clamp", and the
// copies had drifted: the context menu and the tape manager wrapped at the
// ends, the settings page, the palette and the pickers stopped, and home, end
// and the page keys worked in two lists out of twenty. A list now asks this
// package where the cursor goes, and the keys that move it are read in one
// place (Motion), so the rule is the same wherever a person meets it.
//
// The rule:
//   - One step off either end wraps to the other end when wrapping is on
//     (appearance.wrap_lists, on by default). Up on the first row lands on the
//     last, and down on the last lands on the first.
//   - Any longer move, a page or a jump to an end, stops at the end. A page
//     that wrapped would put the cursor somewhere the eye cannot follow.
//   - A list with rows the cursor cannot rest on (a heading, a separator)
//     steps over them, and wrapping steps over them too.
