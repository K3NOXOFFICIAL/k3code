// This file answers "why does my hook not fire?".
//
// A hook whose output and error are discarded looks the same whether its
// command was not found, exited non-zero, was never registered, or worked.
// So hooks report the same three facts the dock's components do, under the
// same field names: last_exit, last_run, last_error.

// stderrTailLimit bounds how many bytes of a hook's stderr are kept. A hook is
// a user command and may write without limit, so the capture is a tail with a
// fixed ceiling rather than a buffer that grows to whatever it was handed.
const stderrTailLimit = 1024

// verbose gates the one line logged per firing. The failure warning is not
// gated: a hook that fails is the thing the user is looking for.
var verbose atomic.Bool

// SetVerbose turns the per-firing log line on or off. The daemon and the client
// both set it from the debug level, so a user chasing a hook turns on logging
// where they already turn it on.
func SetVerbose(on bool) { verbose.Store(on) }

// Verbose reports whether hook firings are logged.
func Verbose() bool { return verbose.Load() }

// Status is what one registered hook command last did. The field names mirror
// the dock's component rows deliberately: an agent that already reads
// list-dock-components can read this without learning a second vocabulary.
type Status struct {
	// Event is the hook event this command is registered on.
	Event string
	// Command is the shell command, exactly as it was configured.
	Command string
	// Runs counts every firing since the table was loaded. Zero is the direct
	// answer to "my hook does not fire": it never ran.
	Runs int
	// LastRun is when the most recent firing finished. Zero when it never ran.
	LastRun time.Time
	// LastExit is the exit code of the most recent firing.
	LastExit int
	// LastDuration is how long the most recent firing took.
	LastDuration time.Duration
	// LastError is the reason the most recent failing firing failed, with the
	// tail of its stderr appended. Empty once a firing succeeds, so a hook that
	// was fixed stops reporting the failure it used to have. Bounded.
	LastError string
