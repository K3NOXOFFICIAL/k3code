// Rect is a half-open rectangle [X0,X1) x [Y0,Y1) in panel-relative cell
// coordinates (0,0 is the panel's top-left cell). Hosts translate an absolute
// mouse position into panel-relative coordinates by subtracting the panel's
// on-screen origin, then hit-test against these.

	X0, Y0, X1, Y1 int
}

// Contains reports whether (x, y) falls inside the rectangle.
func (r Rect) Contains(x, y int) bool {

// Geometry describes the interactive layout of a rendered panel, in
// panel-relative coordinates. A host records the panel's absolute origin when
// it places the panel, then uses these rects to route clicks.

	Tabs          []Rect
	// TabPrev and TabNext are the tab strip's overflow arrows, empty unless the
	// strip is scrolling and has tabs that way. They step the active tab rather
	// than scroll the run past it: the run follows whichever tab is active, so
	// scrolling on its own would have nothing to hold it where the user left it.
	TabPrev, TabNext Rect
	BodyX, BodyY     int // top-left cell of the body area
	InnerWidth       int // content width between the side padding
	// Hints is where each key hint was drawn, one entry per hint asked for and
	// in the order it was given. A narrow frame drops hints (see fitHints),
	// and a dropped hint's entry is the empty Rect, so a host reads entry i as
	// hint i whatever was dropped. Empty for surfaces whose hints are not worth
	// pressing.
