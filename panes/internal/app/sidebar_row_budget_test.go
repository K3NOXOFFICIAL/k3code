// TestRailRowFit pins the arithmetic every budgeted rail row is drawn with.

// Each case is one a simpler rule gets wrong, named in its comment, so a
// change that slides back to one of those rules fails here by name:
//
//   - drop from the end: the old agent row cut its run from the right until it
//     fit, so the token saying what the pane is doing went first.
//   - name first: the name holds its whole width before any token is placed,
//     so one long name leaves every token nothing.
//   - no skip: the first token that does not fit ends the walk, so a long
//     token takes the width a shorter one needed.
