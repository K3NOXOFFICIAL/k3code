// A layout update is not one resize; it is several. Settle the border
// allowance, place the rectangle, reclaim the columns a divider was holding,
// drain a resize the pointer deferred. Each step resizes the pane, and each
// resize announced on its own reaches the guest as a separate SIGWINCH. A
// full-screen program repaints on every one, so a layout-mode switch that left
// a pane exactly the size it started at would cost it two full repaints, and a
// shell would leave two stacked prompts behind.
//
// Only the size a pane settles at is real. settleSizes holds the
// announcements for the duration of an update and sends each pane the one size
// it ended up with, or nothing at all when it ended up where it started.

// settleSizes runs a layout update with every pane's announcement held, then
// tells each pane its settled size once.
//
// Nesting is expected (a mode switch retiles, a retile places panes), so the
// hold is depth counted and only the outermost call releases.

// A pointer gesture is the other shape of the same problem, and settleSizes
// cannot hold it: a drag is not one call, it is a press, a run of motions and a
// release, each arriving as its own message. The sizes in between are not sizes
// the guest was ever meant to live at. A borderless pane gives its shared-border
// allowance up on the first motion so it can draw its own frame, and the retile
// on the drop gives it back; a divider drag moves an edge for every cell the
// pointer crosses. In a tiled layout the pane usually lands the size it started,
// so every one of those was avoidable, and each is a SIGWINCH a shell answers by
// repainting its prompt.
//
// So the hold is armed by the button going down and ended by it coming up. That
// is deliberately wider than "a pane is being dragged": every gesture that can
// move a pane starts with a press, and arming on the press rather than in each
// gesture's own setup means a gesture added later is covered without being told
// to be.
//
// The hold must never outlive the gesture. A pane that holds for ever is a pane
// that never learns its size again, which is worse than the bug. So the end is
// unconditional, and only the first of these is the normal way it happens:
//
//   - the input package's mouse-release path, once the drop has been laid out;
//   - endLostGesture, which is what runs when a release goes missing;
//   - releaseStaleAnnounceHold below, run every maintenance tick, which covers
//     a release that reached none of the above.

// announceHoldTimeout bounds a gesture hold against a pointer that has gone
// silent with a button still believed down. That happens when the release is
// lost outside the surface the events come from and no motion follows to
// correct it: the press said a button is down and nothing ever says otherwise.
//
// It is far longer than resizeDeferralTimeout, which bounds the same kind of
// staleness for the deferred resize, because the two pay opposite costs for
// expiring early. Draining a deferred resize early costs one retile taking the
// full path. Ending this hold early costs the guest the SIGWINCH this whole
// mechanism exists to withhold, and a user who pauses in the middle of a drag
// is doing nothing unusual.
