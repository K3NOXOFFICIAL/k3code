// A guest that streams through a file re-sends whether or not anything moved.
// A browser showing a page that has finished loading hands over a whole new
// bitmap several times a second, and half of those bitmaps are the picture
// already on the screen.
//
// Forwarding one of those costs the host a re-read of the file and a redraw of
// the whole image, because a re-transmitted image does not repaint the
// placement drawn from the old one and so has to be followed by a fresh a=p
// (see "place every frame of a stream, not just the first"). A still page was
// therefore redrawn several times a second for as long as it was open.
//
// The other two transmission paths drop a repeat: the direct one by diffing
// the bitmap, the inline one by hashing it. This pins the same
// behaviour on the file path, and pins the other half of it too: a frame that
// does differ must still get through, or the pane freezes on the frame it
// started with, which is the fault that put the a=p there in the first place.
