// TestPlacementFreezeReleasesOnceSizeSettles pins the rule that a placement is
// recomputed whenever the pane's geometry changes, and is held only while it is
// still changing.
//
// The resize freeze exists to coalesce an interactive drag. The regression this
// guards: a freeze armed by IsBeingManipulated and released only by that flag
// going false, comparing the live size against the size recorded on the last
// unfrozen pass, a record the frozen passes never update. A gesture whose
// release is lost (the pointer leaving the surface mid-drag, which is why
// clearStaleManipulation exists, and which that sweep skips while
// InteractionMode is set) then leaves the pane frozen for good.
//
// Frozen is not idle. The guest is resized, redraws at its new size and keeps
// streaming frames, and every one of those frames is forwarded to the host as a
// fresh bitmap for the same image id. What is not forwarded is a placement, so
// the host keeps scaling each new bitmap into the cell rectangle from before the
// resize: the image stretches, and stays stretched until something clears the
// flag. Clicking the pane does (press sets it, release clears it on every
// window), which is exactly the repair the report describes.
