// Benchmarks do not fail a build, so they cannot stop a performance

// deterministic in a way wall time is not, so they hold up on a loaded
// machine where a timing assertion would flake.
//
// Each ceiling below is the measured count plus a small margin. When one
// trips, the fix is to find the new allocation, not to raise the number: the
// counts here are the ones the paths were profiled at, and per-frame
// allocation was a recurring finding in review.

// skipAllocCountsUnderRace skips a test that asserts an allocation count when
// the binary was built with -race. There sync.Pool drops a share of what is put

// TestCompositorSkipsCleanWindows answers the question the review asked: does
// damage tracking limit work at 207x55, or does every frame redraw everything?
//
// It does limit it, at window granularity. Composing nine windows with one
// dirty costs 137 allocations against 745 with all nine dirty, so the eight
// idle panes are genuinely not re-rendered. (Those figures are from when the
// test was written, with the focused window as the dirty one. It now dirties
// an unfocused window and compares what each case adds over a clean frame:
// 12 against 199 once vt's palette SGR fast path landed, 60 against 583
// before it.)
//
// What this test catches, and what it does not, was established by injection
// rather than assumed, and the answer is worth writing down because it is not
// the obvious one. There are three independent mechanisms that skip work for a
// clean window: the compositor's clean-layer branch, the !needsRedraw test just
// below it, and renderTerminal's own CachedContent branch. They are redundant
// with each other. Disabling any single one of them moves this measurement by
// nothing at all (137 allocations became 137, or 152 in one case) because
// another catches the window first. Only disabling all three together takes it
// to 517 and trips the assertion below.
//
// So this is a guard against damage tracking failing as a whole, not against
// any one layer of it regressing. A change that breaks a single mechanism will
// not be caught here, and the reason is redundancy in the code under test, not
// weakness in the assertion: with the other two still standing, the work
// genuinely is still being skipped.
//
// Note also what it does not claim. Damage tracking stops at the window
// boundary: within a dirty window a single changed cell still re-renders every
// cell, because the dirty signal is one boolean per window. That is measured by
// BenchmarkDamageOneCellVsFullScreen, not asserted here.
