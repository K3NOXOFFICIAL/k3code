// A kitty placement carries two rectangles that have to describe the same
// picture: x,y,w,h select a region of the image, and c,r give the cell box to
// draw it into. A region smaller than its box is magnified to fill it, by
// exactly the ratio between them.
//
// Working out that region needs one number the placement command does not
// carry: how many of the image's pixels one cell is worth. That comes from the
// transmission (a=p says which image and how many cells and nothing about how
// big the image is), and the placement record built for a guest's own a=p did
// not keep it. With nothing to divide, the refresh pass fell back to the host's
// cell size, which is the right answer only for a guest that draws exactly one
// cell's worth of pixels per cell.
//
// A browser does not. Chromium renders at its device pixel ratio, so a pane of
// 119x40 cells is a bitmap of twice that many pixels on each axis, and the
// region asked for was then half the width and half the height of the one that
// belonged in the box: the top-left quarter of the page, drawn across the whole
// pane at twice its size. That matches the report: the same page, legible,
// several times too big.
//
// The first placement is fine, because it is the guest's own a=p forwarded on
// with the guest's own numbers and no region at all. The wrong one is the
// refresh pass's, and the refresh pass only re-places when something changes
// while the render loop is running. That is why the pane was reported to blow
// up not when the image arrived but when a neighbouring pane started printing.

// transmitThenPlace is the efficient shape a long-lived graphics client uses:
// send the bitmap once under an id, then place that id, and keep placing it
// without ever re-sending the pixels.
