// How a rail row fits into a narrow rail.
//
// Every row in the rail is one name with a run of tokens around it: a session
// row carries its branch, its tags and its window count, a machine header the
// word saying why it is not answering, an agent row the session it is in, the
// harness running it, what it is doing, how long it has been doing it and the
// mail waiting for it. All of them have to fit the same 16-column rail. Until
// this file each row cut itself down in its own way, and most of them gave
// the name whatever was left after the right-hand figure, or dropped the last
// token of a run whatever that token said.
//
// It takes herdr's survival rule for the same problem, on the same grid, and
// replaces herdr's round-robin share of the spare cells with a rule that fits
// tokens that are never cut:
//
//  1. Survival from the right. Every token is dropped, then offered back one
//     at a time from the end of the row, and kept only if the whole of it
//     still fits. A token that does not fit is passed over and the next one is
//     still offered its cells, so one long token cannot take the width two
//     shorter ones needed. The rightmost token survives, which on an agent row
//     is the one saying what the pane is doing rather than where it is.
//
//  2. While the tokens are offered their cells, the name holds only its keep
//     (railNameKeep), not its whole width, so one long name cannot starve the
//     tokens beside it.
//
//  3. The name takes every cell the kept tokens leave. herdr hands the spare
//     cells out round-robin because it cuts inside tokens. A token here is
//     kept whole or dropped, so the name is the only thing on the row that
//     can take a spare cell.
//
// Nothing is ever cut inside a token, which is what lets a value rule in
// [appearance.sidebar.agent_row] ink a token by the value the person reads:
// the rule matches "needs input" and the row draws "needs input", never
// "needs in…" wearing the colour of a value that is not on screen. herdr needs
// a dedicated test for that because it truncates inside tokens. Here it falls
// out of the arithmetic.
//
// Separators are part of the token that follows them (or, for a prefix, the
// "/" after it), so a token that goes takes its separator with it and a row
// never ends in a dangling middle dot.
//
// Some tokens are context for the name rather than facts of their own: the
// prefix in front of an agent's name and the branch after a session's. They
// are offered their cells last, and only while the name is drawn whole beside
// them, because "claude/depl…" says less than "deploy" and a branch with its
// name cut from under it says nothing. They are also never passed over: once
// one goes, every one before it goes too, so a prefix never reads as a
// different prefix. "api/deploy" with the harness dropped from between them
// reads as the harness called api. See railToken.Whole.
//
// It costs nothing at rest: it is plain integer arithmetic on widths the row
// has already measured, run only while a row is being drawn.

// railToken is one token of a rail row, as the budget sees it.
