// A strip scrolled to its left end is a position, not a silence, and the wire

// gob omits a field holding its type's zero value, and it flattens a pointer to
// the thing pointed at, so a *int carrying 0 is encoded as nothing at all and
// decodes as nil, "this peer has not said". Home is the commonest place a
// strip is, so that would have made the one offset that matters most the one
// offset that never travels. A non-nil pointer to a struct is not elided, which
// is why ScrollStrip is one.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: this test was written against a *int field and failed on
// exactly the case below, with the round trip returning nil for offset 0 while
// 51 and 65 travelled fine. It caught the bug in a two-client run first: the
// peer followed every step along the strip except the one that ended at home.
