// Every client of a session is written to on a goroutine of its own, so two
// announcements settled close together race for the connection and arrive in
// whichever order the scheduler picks. Each one carries the whole answer (the
// size and the chrome reserve), so taking the older one last does not lose an
// update, it reinstates a wrong one, and it stays wrong until something else
// moves.
//
// That is what the generation on the announcement is for.

// TestClientsConvergeOnOneLayoutUnderConcurrentAnnouncements has two clients
// announcing different chrome at the same time, over and over. Whatever order
// the broadcasts land in, the two have to end up holding the same answer, and
// it has to be the one the daemon holds.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: measured. Without the generation (dropping the check in
// noteSessionLayout), the two clients end up holding different reserves within
// a few rounds, one of them stuck on a value the session has moved past. It is
// the same fault that showed up in internal/app as a focus-switch test failing
// about once in fifty, with the two clients laying panes out in boxes 21
// columns apart. That test is gone; the internal/app convergence harness
// (TestMultiClientConvergence) and e2e TestSessionHoldsOneSizeForTwoClients
// now cover two clients agreeing on the box.
