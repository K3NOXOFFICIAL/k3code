// viewport's width; the retile that followed re-announced only panes whose tile
// size changed, and a pane whose geometry survived kept the lie. Its shell then
// drew prompts wider than the pane and the emulator wrapped them, one wrapped
// prompt per resize, in some panes and not their neighbours.

// retile that moved nothing, arrives with the size the pane already has. Each
// of those used to mark the ring, broadcast a width to every subscriber, resize
// the daemon's emulator (which drops the scroll region a full-screen program
// set) and SIGWINCH the guest into repainting its prompt. Under a reflowing
// emulator a repaint that lands one row short is a line of lost scrollback, so
// a resize that changes nothing was never free.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: fails without the guard at the top of PTY.Resize, where the
// second call appends a second resize mark and broadcasts a width nobody asked
// for.
