// releaseUnreadKittyMedium deletes the shared memory object a kitty t=s
// transmission names, for a pane no client is attached to.
//
// The kitty spec makes the terminal delete the object after it reads it, and
// a guest streaming frames this way never deletes one itself. In a daemon pane
// the reader is the client: its passthrough forwards the name to the host,
// which deletes it, or reads and deletes it itself. With no client attached
// nobody reads the frame, so the daemon is the last reader. A video stream in
// a detached pane otherwise fills /dev/shm, which is memory, at the stream's
// own rate.
//
// Only a single name directly in /dev/shm is deleted, and only when it is the
// frame the command describes: a regular file this user owns, of the size the
// command gives (see vt.KittyMediumIsFrame). The name is text the pane
// printed, and it can name an object another program still uses.
// A temporary file (t=t) is left to the client: no stream seen so far uses
// one, and the checks the spec asks for before deleting one are the client's.
