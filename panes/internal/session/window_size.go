// The window_size policy: which client's size a session with several clients
// takes. It is tmux's window-size option, with the same names.
//
//   - smallest: the smallest client in each dimension. Every client sees the
//     whole session. This is the default, and what every build did before
//     the option existed.
//   - largest: the largest client in each dimension. A smaller client shows
//     the part of the session around the focused pane's cursor.
//   - latest: the client that last had input. A smaller client shows a part,
//     as for largest, and a larger one shows the rest as unused space.
//
// What counts as input is the client's to say, because the client is the only
// side that sees it: a key or a click that tuios itself handles (window
// management, the rail, the dock, a wheel over scrollback) never reaches the
// daemon as pane input. A client reports it with MsgClientActivity. A resize
// is not input, and neither is a focus report or a reply the host terminal
// sends on its own (DA, OSC colours, kitty graphics answers): bubbletea parses
// those into messages of their own, which the client does not report. tmux
// differs in two places, both on purpose: it counts a resize, and a focus-in,
// as activity, so a phone that only attached, or a laptop window that only
// gained focus, takes the session from the person typing on the other one.
//
// The gate. A client too old to say WindowSize in its hello sends no activity,
// and it lays its panes out in min(its terminal, the session), resizing the
// panes' PTYs to fit. Sized larger than it, it would fight every other client
// over the PTY sizes. So while such a client is attached the session takes
// the smallest client, whatever the policy says, and that client sees what it
// always saw.

// latestHold is how long the latest client keeps the session after its last
// input before another client's input can take it.
//
// Without a hold, two people typing at once move the session between their
// sizes on every key, and each move resizes every PTY in it, so every program
// redraws: the layout flaps. Typing has gaps of 100 to 300 ms between keys,
// and key repeat sends faster than that, so a hold well above 300 ms keeps a
// person who is typing from losing the session between two keys. A hold much
// longer than a second makes the switch feel broken to a person who moves to
// the other device and starts typing. One second is the middle of that range.
//
// The switch is not lost when the hold is still running: the daemon arms one
// timer for the moment the hold ends and decides again then. The timer is
// armed only while two clients contend, so an idle session has none.
