// Scratch workspaces.
//
// A scratch group (the built-in scratch terminal, or a [[keybindings.command]]
// entry of type scratch) is a workspace of its own: its panes are ordinary
// windows, tiled by the workspace's BSP tree, on a workspace numbered from
// ScratchWorkspaceBase up. A client shows the group by making that workspace
// its current one and drawing it in a box over the workspace the user left;
// hiding the group is going back. So splits, focus, resize, zoom, the layout
// tree ops and the daemon's save and restore all work inside a scratch with no
// code of their own, and a hidden group is simply a workspace nobody is on.
//
// The numbers are outside 1..NumWorkspaces, so nothing that lists, counts,
// cycles or switches workspaces ever reaches one. The few range checks that
// must let one through (a new window on it, a tree op for it) ask
// IsScratchWorkspace. The daemon picks the number when the group is created
// and every pane of the group carries it, with the group's name in
// WindowState.ScratchName, so no table maps one to the other.
