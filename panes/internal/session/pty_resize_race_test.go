// answer to two clients resizing one pane at once. Each client announces the
// size it laid the pane out at on its own connection, so the daemon meets the
// two in whichever order the sockets deliver them. Whichever it records last
// is the pane's size, and the emulator has to end up at that size too: a
// snapshot handed to the next client is laid out by the emulator, and a later
// announcement of the recorded size is declined as unchanged, so an emulator
// left at the other size stays there.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: with PTY.Resize recording the size under terminalMu and
// queueing the emulator resize under streamMu as two separate critical
// sections, this fails with the pane recording one size and the emulator at
// the other.
