// one message, and whatever arrives is taken for the answer. So nothing may be
// sent to it until that answer has been written: not a resize, not a join
// notification, not a routed command.
//
// The window is real: handleAttach records the client on the session at the top,
// because everything that measures the session has to count it from that moment,
// and writes the reply at the bottom. Between those two the client is a member
// of the session that has not been told so.

// This is the test for that rule, and it is written as a race rather than an
// assertion about ordering, because ordering is what it is about.

// announcing chrome as fast as it can. Every announcement that moves the
// session's reserve is a broadcast to the whole session, so if the broadcast
// set includes a client mid-attach, that client reads the broadcast as its
// attach reply and the attach fails.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: measured. Without the attached gate in broadcastToSession
// this fails within a few rounds, with "unexpected response: 49", message 49
// being MsgSessionResize. The same fault was reaching internal/app as an

// Removing the post-reply check in handleAttach (the one that asks whether the
// session survived the handshake and tells this client itself if it did not)

// hundred. That hole was there before any of this work and is what the test
// found: a session deleted after the client registered on it but before the
// reply put the client in the broadcast set reached neither route, and the
// client sat attached to something that no longer existed.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a control for the other half, the flag being set under
// the same send lock as the reply. That window is a few instructions wide and
// this test does not reach it: sixty runs plain and twenty under -race with the
// mark moved back after the write, and not one failure. That ordering is here
