// Every overlay that filters as you type takes the same two things: a space,
// and a character that is more than one byte. Three of them took printable
// ASCII only, so a name with a space in it could not be searched for past its
// first word, and ten truncated the query by bytes on backspace, which splits
// a multi-byte character and leaves invalid UTF-8 behind.
//
// This checks the whole package at once rather than one handler at a time,
// because the fault was that each handler had its own copy of the rule and
// they drifted. See the shared list grammar in internal/app.

// TestEditFilterQuery pins the shared edit rule the filtering overlays call.
