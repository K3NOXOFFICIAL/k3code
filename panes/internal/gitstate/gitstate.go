// Package gitstate reads the git facts a sidebar can usefully carry in a narrow
// column: which branch a directory is on, and how far that branch has drifted
// from its upstream.
//
// It does not report whether the tree is dirty, and that is a decision rather
// than an omission. Dirtiness is the one git fact that cannot be had without
// walking the working tree, so it is the one that makes a sidebar stutter on a
// large repository, and it is also the fact a person is least likely to be
// surprised by: you know whether you have edited something. Branch and
// divergence are the two you cannot know without being told.
//
// The cost model is the point of this package. Everything except the divergence
// counts is a file read: HEAD, one ref, and the config. Counting how far two
// commits have diverged needs the commit graph, so that part shells out to git,
// and it only shells out when the two commits have actually moved. Their hashes
// are read from files, so the check that decides whether to spend a subprocess
// is itself two file reads.
