// Neighbour picks the rectangle focus moves to when it steps from from toward
// side, and returns its index in cands, or -1 when nothing lies that way.
//
// A candidate lies that way when both of its edges on that axis are further
// along than from's: for right, it starts right of from's left edge and ends
// right of from's right edge. That holds for a tiled neighbour, for one that
// shares a border cell, and for a floating window that half covers from.
//
// Among those, the ones that face from (share at least one cell across the
// axis) win. The nearest wins among them. At the same distance, one sharing two
// or more cells beats one sharing a single cell: with shared borders, panes
// that only meet at a corner share exactly one cell, so a step down from a
// short pane must not land on the tall pane beside the one below it. A single
// cell still counts when nothing else touches that side, since a pane can meet
// its only neighbour along one row. After that, the one whose centre is closest
// to from's across the axis wins, then the one sharing the most, then the
// earlier index. In a tiled layout that is always a pane touching from on that
// side, whatever the nesting of the splits.
//
// When nothing faces from and fallback is true, the nearest candidate lying
// that way is taken instead, counting distance across the axis double. That is
// for floating windows, which need not line up at all. A tiled layout passes
// false: its panes cover the screen, so a pane with nothing facing it on a side
// is at the edge, and a diagonal jump there would not be the direction pressed.
