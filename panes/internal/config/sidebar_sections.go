// The rail's layout string, appearance.sidebar.sections.
//
// The syntax lives here rather than in the renderer because two callers need
// it and they must agree: the rail, which lays itself out from it on every
// frame, and the config validator, which tells a person what they typed wrong.
// A second parser in the validator would be a second opinion about what the
// string means.

// SidebarSectionShare is one entry of the layout: a section, and the share of
// the rail it may claim.

//
// It is forgiving on purpose: an unknown name, a percent that is not a number
// and a repeated section name are all dropped rather than refused, because the
// rail draws from this on every frame and a rail that refuses to lay itself out
// is worse than one that lays itself out slightly differently from what was
// typed. SidebarSectionProblems is where a person is told what was wrong. A
// string with no section in it falls back to the shipped layout, since a rail
// of nothing but empty blocks is not a state anybody meant to ask for.
//
// The spacer is the exception to the repeat rule. It names a place rather than
// a section, so a layout may carry as many as it likes and each one is its own
