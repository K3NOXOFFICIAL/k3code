//   - A spacer may be listed more than once. Every other name is dropped the
//     second time it appears, because a rail cannot draw one list in two
//     places. A spacer names a place rather than a list, so two of them are two
//     gaps and both have to survive, shares included, since ":10" twice over is
//     the spelling a parser keyed by name would get wrong. Negative control:
//     put the spacer back inside the seen check in ParseSidebarSections.
//   - A repeated section is still dropped: the spacer is the exception, and it
//     did not become the rule. Negative control: skip the seen check for every
//     name.
//   - A layout of nothing but spacers falls back to the shipped one, since it
//     would lay out to a column of blank lines nobody can get out of from
//     inside the rail. Negative control: count len(out) instead of sections in
//     the fallback.
//   - A layout a config already carries parses back unchanged: the grammar did
//     not change under it, only what it may additionally hold.
