// SpotlightConfig is the [spotlight] section: a beam that lights one part of
// the screen and turns the light down on everything outside it.
//
// It is a presentation aid, not a mode. Nothing about it is session state: a
// second client attached to the same session sees its own screen unchanged,
// the same way it does for the showkeys overlay and the theme. What lives here
// is the shape of the beam and where it follows, so a person who wants it can
// keep it across restarts.
//
// Enabled is a pointer so that turning the beam off in the settings page
// survives a reload rather than reading as "unset" and snapping back on.
type SpotlightConfig struct {
	Enabled *bool  `toml:"enabled"` // draw the beam from startup (default: false)
	Follow  string `toml:"follow"`  // what the beam is anchored to (default: mouse)
	Radius  int    `toml:"radius"`  // half the beam's height, in rows (default: 10)
	Dim     int    `toml:"dim"`     // percent of its light an unlit cell loses (default: 75)
	Edge    string `toml:"edge"`    // hard cut or soft rim (default: hard)
	Shake   bool   `toml:"shake"`   // a shake of the pointer toggles the beam (default: false)
}

// What the beam follows.
//
// Mouse is the default because it is what a person means by a spotlight: they
// point at the thing they are talking about. Cursor was the first default and
// it was chosen on cost rather than on what anyone asked for, which is the
// wrong way round for a feature whose whole job is to put the light where the
// audience should look.
//
// The cost is real and it is why cursor stays. A cursor-anchored beam moves
// only on frames that are being composed anyway, because getRealCursor already
// resolves the position for the hardware cursor. A mouse-anchored one asks for
// a frame per pointer move, which the motion throttle caps at the frame rate:
// about 1.8 KB per frame with a hard edge and 4.9 KB with a soft one, and only
// while the pointer is moving. On a local terminal that is nothing. Over SSH or
// in the browser client a continuous swipe is a steady tens of KB a second, so
// a remote client that wants the beam should set follow = "cursor".
//
// Neither costs anything at all with the beam off, which is how it ships.
//
// The two never mix. A rule that picked whichever moved last would put two
// sources on one beam and make the screen jump for a reason the user cannot
// see.

//
// Hard cuts at the radius. Soft fades over the outer part of it, which reads
// more like a light and costs about three times the bytes each time the beam
// moves: the rim is a ring of sixteen colour steps, and every step is a style
// change the terminal has to be told about. Measured at radius 10 on a
// nine-pane 207x55 screen, one cell of movement is 1.8 KB hard and 4.9 KB
// soft. Hard is the default for that reason, and a local session can afford
// soft.
