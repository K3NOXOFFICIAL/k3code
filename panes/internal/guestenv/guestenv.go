// (codex-rs/tui/src/notifications/mod.rs and codex-rs/terminal-detection in

// splits panes through tmux reaches the outer tmux instead of the pane it is
// in. The pane is a tuios pane, so these are removed.
//
// The same holds for an enclosing herdr. HERDR_ENV and the pane ids name the
// herdr pane tuios runs in: Crush, and herdr's own hooks, report to it when
// they see them, so an agent in a tuios pane would set the state of the outer
// herdr pane. HERDR_BIN_PATH goes too: under an outer tuios it names that
// tuios, whose report commands would report to the outer pane. It is set
// again for a pane this tuios tells about its own socket.
// HERDR_SOCKET_PATH stays, since it names herdr's server and says nothing
// about which pane a process is in; a pane tuios tells about its own herdr
// protocol socket gets it replaced (see session.Manager.HerdrEnv).
//
// An enclosing tuios is the same case. A daemon or a standalone tuios started
// from a tuios pane inherits that pane's TUIOS_ variables, and its own panes
// would name the outer pane, session and socket where they set none of their
// own. The ones a pane sets for itself are set again after this filter.
