// Conformance for the left and right margins: DECLRMM (private mode 69) and
// DECSLRM (CSI Pl ; Pr s).
//
// conform_margins_test.go covers the vertical pair. The horizontal pair had no
// tests at all, which matters more than it sounds: this emulator answers
// DECLRMM with a set, so a guest that asks for horizontal margins is told it
// has them. Advertising a feature and then ignoring half of it is worse than
// refusing it, because the guest lays its output out on the strength of the
// answer.
//
// Cases follow the VT420 and VT510 reference manuals for DECSLRM and DECLRMM,
// esctest tests/decslrm.py, and xterm's implementation, which is where the
// feature reached the modern world.
