// Conformance for OSC payloads that are truncated, oversized or hostile.
//
// conform_string_test.go covers the OSC commands this emulator implements with
// payloads they expect. This covers the parser underneath them: which
// terminators end a string, which control bytes abort one, and what happens
// when a guest sends a megabyte and no terminator at all. An OSC accumulator is
// the one place in a terminal where a guest chooses how much memory to spend,
// and this one runs in the daemon, so the answer has to be bounded.
//
// Cases follow kitty's kitty_tests/parser.py, ghostty's src/terminal/osc.zig
// tests, and xterm's rules for what ends a string in charproc.c.

		// The eight-bit ST does not end an OSC here, and that is a decision
		// rather than an omission.
		//
		// It is one byte, 0x9C, and it is also the middle byte of U+2733 and
		// of everything else whose encoding carries it. This terminal is
		// always UTF-8, so the two uses cannot both be honoured: a title of
		// "✳ Say hello in three words" ended its own OSC after one byte and
		// printed the rest at the cursor, which in a terminal UI is wherever
		// the program last put it. That was reported as text appearing inside
		// an input box.
		//
		// xterm makes the same choice, honouring eight-bit controls only when
		// it is not in UTF-8 mode, and the scanner for the other backend in
		// this repository already says so in its own header.
		//
		// What is given up is real: a guest that sends a bare 0x9C to end a
		// string will have that string run on until a BEL, an ESC-backslash,
		// or the length cap. No program that expects to run in a UTF-8
		// terminal sends one, because it is ambiguous for them too.
