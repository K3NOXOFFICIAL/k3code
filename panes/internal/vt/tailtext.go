// TailText returns the last n rows of the active screen that carry text, in

// Blank rows are skipped rather than counted. An agent draws its live state in a
// box at the bottom of the pane and pads below it, so counting the padding would
// push the box out of the window a rule can see.
//
// It reads the active screen, so a harness drawing in the alternate screen is
// still readable. Reading further up than a handful of rows finds transcript
// history, which says what the agent did rather than what it is doing.
//
// NOT REENTRANT. The caller holds the terminal lock, the same as
// GetTerminalState.
