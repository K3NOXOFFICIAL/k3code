// Conformance for a screen that gets shorter or taller.
//
// A shorter screen has to put rows somewhere. Ghostty and kitty take the blank
// rows below the cursor first and then move rows off the top into the
// scrollback, so no row that holds text is lost. tmux deletes the rows below
// the cursor whatever they hold. This emulator follows ghostty, the other
// backend tuios builds, so a pane reads the same on either.
