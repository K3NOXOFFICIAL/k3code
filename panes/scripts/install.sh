# Build tuios from this checkout and install it on your PATH as `tuios` and
# `tuios-web`.
#
# Both are installed together and stamped with the same commit, because they are
# two halves of one thing: tuios-web is a client of the same daemon, and a
# tuios-web left behind by an upgrade is a client running last month's code
# against this month's daemon. The two builds are compared at the handshake and
# the window reports a mismatch, but the better answer is that it does not
# happen.
#
# Usage: scripts/install.sh [pure|ghostty] [options]
#
#   pure      link the pure Go emulator (default). Needs nothing but go.
#   ghostty   link the libghostty-vt emulator. Needs zig; the pinned
#             static library is built on first use and cached in .ghostty-vt/.
#
#   --prefix DIR    install into DIR (default: $TUIOS_PREFIX, else ~/.local/bin)
#   --kill-server   stop a running daemon after installing, without asking
#   --keep-server   leave a running daemon alone, without asking
#   -h, --help      show this text
#
# Both backends install under the same name, so switching is one run of this
# script with the other name. `tuios --version` reports which one is installed.
