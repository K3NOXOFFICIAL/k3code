// making a session from the rail's "+ new" used to land on a single pane
// floating at the mouse, because the daemon creates a session with AutoTiling
// false and only the one-shot boot path ever consulted the user's setting.
//
// The assertion is geometry, not pixels: the created session's only pane must
// fill the content area rather than sit at the half-size placement box
// NewWindowPlacement hands an untiled window.
