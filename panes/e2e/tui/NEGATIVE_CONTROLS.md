# Negative controls for the end-to-end suite

A regression test that has never been observed to fail on broken code is not
evidence. Every test in this package that claims to cover a specific bug was run
against a binary built with that bug's fix removed, and the result is recorded
below. Two of them are **not** caught here; that is written down rather than
papered over, because a suite whose real coverage is unknown is worse than no
suite.

## Two rules for every control

Three green suites hid three real defects in one week. All three had a negative
control, and all three controls passed. These two rules are what the misses have
in common. They apply to every test in the project, not only this suite.

### 1. A negative test needs its positive half

A test that asserts "X does not happen when Y" must also assert, in the same
fixture, "X happens when not Y".

Without the positive half, the negative half may never have tested Y at all. A
gate written `if A && B && C` is only a test of `C` while `A` and `B` are true.
One privacy gate was asserted by a fixture that failed an earlier term, so the
test read the right answer off the wrong reason, and the gate could be deleted
with three packages still green.

The positive half costs one more row in the table. If it fails, the negative
half was never testing what its name says.

### 2. The control deletes the call site, not the function

When a pull request adds a feature, cut its wiring: the `case`, the `Register`,
the route, the gate line. Do not cut the function under it.

A control on the function proves the test and the function are bound to each
other. It says nothing about whether anything calls the function. One feature
registered 18 actions that no key reached. Its eight controls all passed,
because all eight cut the handler and the fault was the switch above it.

Cut the wiring, run the named test, and watch it fail. If it does not fail, the
test enters the code below the fault, and the fault is what nobody is testing.

## How to rebuild a control

The controls are built by removing one fix from the current tree, so they differ
from the shipping binary only in that fix. Checking out the pre-fix ancestor
instead would drag in unrelated differences and prove less.

```sh
git clone --shared . /tmp/negctl && cd /tmp/negctl
git checkout -f <base>          # the commit the suite was written against

# then either revert the fix hunk:
git show <fix-sha> -- <file> | git apply -R -
# or inject the fault by hand, when later commits have moved the code

go build -o /tmp/tuios-broken ./cmd/tuios
```

Run the suite against it from `e2e/tui`:

```sh
TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-broken go test -count=1 -timeout 550s .
```

`-count=1` is mandatory. Go's test cache will happily replay a previous PASS
across a change of `TUIOS_E2E_BIN`, which during the writing of this suite made
a working negative control look like a broken one for half an hour.

## Results

| Bug | Fix removed | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File search cannot open from a terminal pane through the leader shortcut | whole change | build main before the file search change and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestSidebarFileSearch/standalone` and `/daemon` (both time out waiting for `Search files`) | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| Sidebar file search absent | whole feature | build main before the file search change and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestSidebarFileSearch/standalone` and `/daemon` (both time out waiting for `Search files`) | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| Sidebar Shift+Enter never reaches the editor action | n/a, injected | keep the feature but clear the default `file_edit` binding in `internal/config/userconfig.go` | `TestSidebarFileEditor/standalone` and `/daemon` (both time out waiting for the binary-file refusal, before the positive editor assertion) | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| Freeze: render path took the window I/O read lock twice | `6ca26b1` | revert `internal/app/render_terminal.go` hunk | `TestSustainedOutputKeepsRendering` (hangs at round 1/6), `TestSoakMixedActivity` (hangs at cycle 2/8) | **caught** |
| Blank pane: `clipWindowContent` measured width from `lines[0]` | `b9f770b` | revert `internal/app/render_helpers.go` hunk | `TestAltScreenPaneSurvivesFocusSwitch`, `TestLeftmostTileWithBlankFirstLineIsNotDiscarded` | **caught** |
| Blank pane: a transient blank frame became the render cache | `11a0023` | neuter the `isBlankRender` guard in `cacheRender` | none | **not caught** |
| Torn cell buffer: emulator resized without the window I/O lock | `fd1463e` | drop both `LockIO`/`UnlockIO` pairs around `Terminal.Resize` in `internal/app/session.go` | none (2 full runs) | **not caught** |
| Mouse: the wheel announced a mode, stranded the user in it, and a drag moved the window instead of selecting | whole change | build the merge-base (`2005b01`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestWheelScrollShowsScrollbackWithoutAnnouncingAMode`, `TestWheelDownToBottomReturnsToLiveOutput`, `TestTypingWhileScrolledSnapsBackToLiveOutput`, `TestDragSelectionCopiesOnRelease`, `TestDoubleClickCopiesAWordAndTripleClickTheLine` | **caught** |
| Mouse: the wheel over a pane that asked for the mouse | n/a, never broken | same binary | none, and that is correct: `TestMouseTrackingAppKeepsItsOwnWheel` passes on both, because it guards behaviour that already worked | **guard, not a control** |
| Clipboard: every mouse release copies, so a bare single click clobbers the clipboard | n/a, injected | `deliberate := moved \|\| window.ClickCount >= 2` → `deliberate := true` in `internal/input/mouse_select.go` | `TestDoubleClickCopiesAWordAndTripleClickTheLine` ("the gesture wrote the clipboard more times than it should: got [\"b\"], want []") | **caught, and invisible before this change** |
| Drag state never cleared on release, so one click freezes every pane forever | n/a, injected | drop `o.Dragging = false` from the copy-mode branch of `handleMouseRelease` | `TestClickInPaneDoesNotFreezeOutput` | **caught, and invisible before this change** |
| Agent-state feature absent (no verb, no indicator) | whole feature | build `origin/main` and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestAgentStateIndicatorRenders` (fails at the set step: `Unknown command "set-agent-state"`) | **caught** |
| Two clients with different chrome laid the panes out in different boxes, dragging the shared PTYs between the two answers | n/a, see verdict | `paneReserve` in `internal/app/os_geometry.go` returns `m.OwnLayoutReserve()` instead of folding in `m.SessionReserve` | none | **not caught**, see below |
| Pane body one column wider than the renderer vouches for, with the wrap skipped | n/a, injected | append a space to every row of the cell loop's output in `internal/app/render_terminal.go` while still reporting `maxX` | `TestWideRunesKeepThePaneRectangleOnScreen` ("pane has no right border glyph beside its content at column 119, its body is not 78 columns wide"), `TestSkippingTheWrapDrawsTheSameScreenAsWrapping` | **caught** |
| A workspace round trip threw away where the strip was scrolled to | n/a, see verdict | `ScrollingOnFocusChange` in `internal/app/os_scrolling.go` calls `sl.ScrollToFocusedColumn` instead of `sl.EnsureFocusedVisible` | `TestWorkspaceRoundTripKeepsTheScrolledStrip` ("a workspace round trip moved the strip. The focused column was on screen the whole time") | **caught** |
| The strip stops revealing a focused column with none of it on screen | n/a, injected | `EnsureFocusedVisible` in `internal/layout/scrolling.go` returns without calling `reveal` | `TestWorkspaceRoundTripRevealsAHiddenColumn` ("the round trip left the focused column off screen") | **caught**, and it is the positive control on the row above |
| A click that only focuses a borderless pane untiled it, resized it, and retiled it, so the shell took two SIGWINCH and printed a new line | n/a, see verdict | put the untile back on the press: move the `win.Tiled = false` / `win.Resize` pair from `untilePaneForDrag` (called from the drag branch of `handleMouseMotion`) back into `beginWindowDrag` in `internal/input/mouse_click.go` | `TestClickToFocusAddsNoLineToThePane` ("the pane took 6 resizes across three click-to-focus round trips") | **caught** |
| A pane being dragged keeps the borderless allowance, so it draws no border | n/a, injected | make `untilePaneForDrag` return before it clears `Tiled` | `TestDraggingAPaneDoesResizeIt`, since replaced by `TestDraggingTheDividerResizesOnce` | **caught** at the time; see the drag-announcement rows below for why that test is gone |
| A drag announced every size it passed through, so rearranging tiles left a new line in each pane | n/a, see verdict | drop `m.holdGestureAnnouncements()` from the `tea.MouseClickMsg` case in `internal/app/update.go` | `TestDragIntoASameSizeSlotResizesNothing` ("the pane took 2 resizes across a drag that returned it to the same size"), `TestDragIntoADifferentSizeSlotResizesOnce` ("announced 3 of them, want 1"); unit `TestDragBackIntoASameSizeSlotTellsTheGuestNothing` (since removed) | **caught** |
| Nothing ends the hold, so a pane never learns its size again | n/a, injected, cuts all four call sites | drop `o.ReleaseGestureAnnouncements()` from the release defer in `internal/input/mouse_release.go` and from the `MouseReleaseMsg` case in `internal/input/handler.go`, `m.releaseGestureAnnouncements()` from `endLostGesture`, and `m.releaseStaleAnnounceHold()` from the maintenance tick | `TestDraggingTheDividerResizesOnce` ("announced 0 resizes, want 1"), `TestDragIntoADifferentSizeSlotResizesOnce` ("announced 0 of them, want 1"); unit `TestDraggingTheDividerTellsTheGuestOnce` | **caught**, and it is the positive control on the row above |
| The release handler alone stops ending the hold | n/a, injected | drop only the two `o.ReleaseGestureAnnouncements()` calls in `internal/input` | none here, and that is correct: the maintenance tick's backstop still ends the hold inside the three seconds these tests wait, which is the redundancy it exists for. Unit `TestDraggingTheDividerTellsTheGuestOnce` fails ("told the guest [], want one size") | **not caught here, caught in `internal/input`** |
| The idle diet sleeps through a stranded hold | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | make the `m.staleAnnounceHold()` branch in `tickNeedsWork` unreachable, or drop `m.releaseStaleAnnounceHold()` from the tick body | unit `TestAReleaseThatWentMissingStillEndsTheHold`, `TestAPointerGoneSilentStillEndsTheHold` ("the hold survived a tick with no button held") | **caught in `internal/app`** |
| A retile inside a gesture ends the gesture's own hold | n/a, injected | `ReleaseAnnouncements` in `internal/terminal/window_geometry.go` back to clearing the count instead of decrementing it | none here; unit `TestALayoutUpdateInsideAGestureDoesNotEndItsHold` ("a layout update inside the gesture told the pane [[58 28]]") | **not caught here, caught in `internal/app`** |
| Keyboard focus resizes the pane it moves to (a report from macOS, after the click and drag fixes; no keyboard path does this on Linux, so there is nothing to remove) | n/a, injected | add `Resize(Width-1, Height)` then `Resize(Width+1, Height)` to `FocusWindow` in `internal/app/os_window.go`, after the cache invalidation, and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at that build | `TestFocusTabAddsNoLine`, `TestFocusAltArrowsAddNoLine`, `TestFocusAltArrowsStandaloneAddNoLine`, `TestFocusAltArrowsScrollingAddNoLine` (each "the pane took 3 resizes across ..., and printed a line for each"); positive half `TestSwapIntoANarrowerSlotIsTold` in the same fixture | **caught** (4 of 4 run) |
| The same, with fish in the panes, animations on, a simulated kitty host and the ghostty backend, after a recording showed the bug with fish on macOS | n/a, injected | the same `FocusWindow` mutant | `TestFocusAltArrowsFishAddNoLine`, `TestFocusTabFishAddsNoLine` ("the pane took 3 resizes") | **caught** |
| The render trace stops recording the sizes handed to a guest, so the diagnostic the macOS report is asked to run says nothing | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | drop `terminal.AnnounceTrace = traceAnnounce` from the `init` in `internal/app/render_trace.go` and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at that build | `TestRenderTraceRecordsEachAnnouncement` ("the trace holds 0 announce lines after a swap of two panes, want at least 2"); unit `TestAnnounceTraceSeesEverySizeHandedToTheGuest` (since removed) fails when the call in `tellGuest` is cut ("a resize to 80x40 traced [], want [[80 40]]"), and a unit test, since removed, failed when the `LogBasic` in `PTY.Resize` was cut ("log has 0 lines") | **caught** |
| Two clients whose configs disagree on shared borders partitioned the box with different arithmetic, dragging the shared PTYs between the two answers | whole change | build the pre-fix tree (`20f17bbd`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestGeometryConfigDisagreementDoesNotMovePanes` ("the second client's attach moved the panes": 61,0 59x38 dragged to 60,0 60x38) | **caught** |
| Raising a floating pane reshuffled the others: `RecalcZOrder` renumbered by list position | n/a, injected | drop the `slices.SortStableFunc` over the current Z in `internal/app/os_window.go` | `TestClickingAPaneKeepsTheOthersInOrder` ("clicking A put C over B"); unit `TestRecalcZOrderKeepsTheStackingOrder` | **caught** |
| Floating band unbounded at 999 plus Z, over the which-key overlay, the clock, the log viewer and the scrollback browser | n/a, injected | `ZIndexSeparators`/`ZIndexAnimating` back to 998/999 and `windowLayerZ` back to `ZIndexSeparators + 1 + Z` | `TestAFloatingPaneStaysUnderTheWhichKeyOverlay` ("row 33 still shows the floating pane through the which-key overlay"); unit `TestFloatingWindowsStayBelowEveryOverlay` | **caught** |
| Tiling off under the scrolling layout left the columns past the edge at x = -144 | n/a, injected | drop `m.bringPanesIntoView()` from `leaveTiling` in `internal/app/tiling.go` | `TestTilingOffBringsTheStripOnScreen`, all four doors ("3 pane(s) are still off screen"); unit `TestTilingOffBringsTheStripOnScreen`, `TestEveryWayOfTurningTilingOffAgrees` | **caught** |
| Tape `DisableTiling` flipped the flag and nothing else, leaving borderless panes with no dividers | n/a, injected | `DisableTiling` in `internal/app/os_tape_executor.go` back to `m.AutoTiling = false` | `TestTapeTilingCommandsSettleTheBorders` ("after DisableTiling: 0 pane corners on screen, want 2"); unit `TestEveryWayOfTurningTilingOffAgrees/tape_DisableTiling` | **caught** |
| A peer that watched tiling turn off kept its panes borderless | n/a, injected | gate the `tilingWasOn && !m.AutoTiling` case in `ApplyStateSync` behind `false` | `TestAPeerSeesTilingTurnOff` ("the peer: 0 pane corners on screen, want 2"); unit `TestPeerTurningTilingOffClearsTheBorderFlags` (since removed) | **caught** |
| The rest of the tiling-switch change: the fresh tree on enable, the stale-tree rebuild, the palette row's own copy, the preselection left armed, the float's column left in the strip, a dragged float under the other floats, the minimized pane's border flag, session-info saying `bsp`, and a door that never flips | n/a, injected, one hunk each | see `internal/app/tiling_switch_test.go`; nine mutations | unit tests only, each fails as an assertion | **caught** (14 of 14 mutations in this change) |
| The spotlight dimmed the text outside the beam and left the screen that text sat on lit, at every setting up to the maximum | n/a, injected | `buildRun` in `internal/app/spotlight.go` blends the background toward `s.groundBg` again instead of `spotlightDark` | `TestSpotlightTurnsTheBackgroundDownOnScreen` ("the background outside the beam carries 114 of light against the ground's 106"); unit `TestSpotlightTurnsTheLightDownOnTheBackground` (since removed), `TestSpotlightDimsALightThemeDownwards` | **caught** |
| A cell that named no background of its own was given none, which is most of a real screen | n/a, injected | `dimCell` writes the background only when the cell already carried one | `TestSpotlightTurnsTheBackgroundDownOnScreen` ("the marker outside the beam came back with no background at all"); unit `TestSpotlightDimsTextTheGuestLeftAtTheDefault` (since removed) | **caught** |
| The beam followed the focused pane's cursor rather than the pointer | n/a, injected | `defaultSpotlightConfig` in `internal/config/spotlight.go` back to `SpotlightFollowCursor` | `TestSpotlightFollowsTheMouse` ("the marker never came back to full brightness after the pointer moved onto it"); unit `TestSpotlightDefaultsAreTheOnesTheRegistryPublishes` (since removed) | **caught** |
| Nothing read the pointer's position into the beam | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `LastMouseX`/`LastMouseY` branch from `spotlightAnchor` in `internal/app/spotlight.go` | `TestSpotlightFollowsTheMouse` | **caught** |
| Blur left the last pointer shape standing: the terminal paints the last OSC 22 it was sent wherever the pointer lands after refocus, so resize arrows sat over pane content | whole change | build main before the fix (the `m.ResetPointerShape()` in the `tea.BlurMsg` case of `internal/app/update.go` is the whole fix) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestBlurRetiresThePointerShape` ("after the host lost focus: the host pointer shape is \"nwse-resize\", want \"default\"") | **caught** |
| A new BSP window split the last pane in the tree, the bottom-right one, whatever had focus, and a daemon session dropped the preselection (discussion #347) | whole change | build `origin/main` before the fix and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPane`, all six cases ("the new pane is not inside the focused pane's old box": the new pane split the pane at 80,23), `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPaneStandalone`, all three cases ("pane {X:80 Y:23 ...} moved") | **caught** |
| The daemon sync stops splitting the focused pane | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `m.insertSyncedWindow(created[0], focusBefore)` call from `adoptSyncedWindows` in `internal/app/session.go` | `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPane`, all six cases ("the new pane is not inside the focused pane's old box") | **caught** |
| A daemon session drops the preselection on its way to the sync | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | make the `m.PreselectionDir` branch in the daemon half of `AddWindowIn` in `internal/app/os_window.go` unreachable | `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPane`, the four preselect cases ("the new pane is not left of the focused pane", and above, below, right of); the two cases with no preselection pass, which is their positive half | **caught** |
| The standalone TUI stops splitting the focused pane | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop `targetID = fw.ID` from `AddWindowToBSPTree` in `internal/app/tiling_bsp.go` | `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPaneStandalone`, all three cases; the daemon test passes, since that path does not run there | **caught** |
| An `a=T` carrying `U=1` (ntcharts/picture, `kitten icat --unicode-placeholder`) was treated as a real placement: rows reserved, which scrolled the guest's screen every frame, and the image placed at the cursor | whole change | stash the five hunks in `internal/app/kitty_passthrough_forward.go`, `kitty_file_medium.go`, `kitty_passthrough.go`, `kitty_passthrough_lifecycle.go` and `internal/vt/utf8.go` | `TestKittyVirtualPlacementLeavesThePaneToTheGuest/b64`, `/file`, `/daemon-b64` ("39 placements were drawn at a cursor position", "the guest's PLACEHOLDER-HEADER is gone from the pane"), `TestKittyPlaceholderSplitAcrossWritesNamesTheHostImage`, `TestKittyPlaceholdersPrintedBeforeTheImageNameIt` | **caught** (3 of 3 transports run; `/shm` skips without `/dev/shm`) |
| The same, the row reservation alone | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `if cmd.Virtual { break }` from the `TransmitPlace` case of `ForwardCommand` | `/file` ("PLACEHOLDER-HEADER is gone"); `/b64` passes, and that is correct: a chunked transmission's last chunk arrives as `a=t` and never reaches that branch | **caught** |
| The same, the chunked direct path alone | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `pending.AndPlace && pending.Virtual` block from `forwardTransmit` | `/b64`, `/daemon-b64` ("no virtual placement reached the host", "39 placements were drawn at a cursor position"), and the split and early tests through the lost text | **caught** |

| The same, over ssh: a reused id went out as a self-placed `a=T` at the cursor | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `andPlace && cmd.Virtual` block from `forwardFileTransmitInline` | unit `TestKittyVirtualPlacementOverSSHIsNeverSelfPlaced` ("3 frames sent 1 transmissions and 0 virtual placements") | **caught in `internal/app`** |
| A placeholder cell split across two PTY reads was re-drawn with the guest's image id | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `rewriteKittyPlaceholder` call from `extendOpenGrapheme` in `internal/vt/utf8.go` | `TestKittyPlaceholderSplitAcrossWritesNamesTheHostImage` ("241 placeholder cells reached the host naming image 7"); every transport of the placement test too, with a cell or two each, which is where the pty's own read boundaries fell | **caught** |
| Placeholder cells printed before the image was transmitted kept the guest's id | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | the translator in `setupKittyPassthrough` calls `HostImageID` instead of `HostImageIDForPlaceholder` | `TestKittyPlaceholdersPrintedBeforeTheImageNameIt` ("cells by id: map[7:4012]") | **caught**, and it is the positive control on the row above: with the id allocated on demand the split test still passes, so the two hunks are tested apart |
| A daemon state broadcast flipped a streamed pane back to the normal screen, and the passthrough deleted the alternate-screen image | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `updateWindowFromState` in `internal/app/session.go` calls `w.SetAltScreen(ws.IsAltScreen)` for every window again, without the `SubscribedPTYs` check (the tree before the fix) | `TestKittyAltScreenImageSurvivesStateSync` ("a daemon state broadcast took the image down: a=d a=d,d=i,i=1,q=2") | **caught** |
| A reused shared memory frame waited for the render loop: an `a=t` on arrival and an `a=p` on the next pass | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `streamFrameFitsPlacement` branch from `forwardFileTransmit` in `internal/app/kitty_passthrough_forward.go` (the tree before the fix) | `TestKittySharedMemoryStreamIsWrittenAtOnce` ("only 0 frames went out at once as a=T") | **caught** |
| A shared memory frame tuios dropped as a repeat of the one on screen stayed in `/dev/shm`: nobody read it, so nobody deleted it | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `releaseKittyMedium` call from the identical-frame branch of `forwardFileTransmit` in `internal/app/kitty_passthrough_forward.go` | `TestKittySharedMemoryFramesAreReleased/repeats` ("39 shared memory objects were never sent to the host and never deleted") | **caught**; `/daemon-unwatched` still passes, so the two call sites are tested apart |
| A shared memory frame in a daemon pane with no client attached stayed in `/dev/shm` | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `releaseUnreadKittyMedium` call from the kitty callback in `createPTY` in `internal/session/session.go` | `TestKittySharedMemoryFramesAreReleased/daemon-unwatched` ("40 shared memory objects were never sent to the host and never deleted") | **caught**; `/repeats` still passes |
| The daemon deleted any regular file in `/dev/shm` a pane named, whatever its size, so printed text could remove another program's segment | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | put back the bare `info.Mode().IsRegular()` test in place of `vt.KittyMediumIsFrame` in `releaseUnreadKittyMedium`, `internal/session/kitty_medium.go` | `TestKittySharedMemoryFramesAreReleased/daemon-unwatched-wrong-size` ("40 of 40 objects of the wrong size were deleted") | **caught**; `/daemon-unwatched` still passes, its positive half: the same path deletes frames of the right size |

| The client deleted the object a pane named while graphics were off, a frame it never looked at | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | put back a `kittyMediumPath` and `releaseKittyMedium` call in the `!kp.enabled` branch of `ForwardCommand` in `internal/app/kitty_passthrough_forward.go` | Unit `TestKittyMediumReleaseChecksTheFrame/graphics-off` ("tuios deleted an object while graphics are off") | **caught** |
| The frame check ignored the owner or the size | n/a, injected | make `kittyOwnedByMe` always true, or drop the size compare, in `vt.KittyMediumIsFrame` (`internal/vt/kitty_medium_release.go`) | Unit `TestKittyMediumIsFrame/another_user` ("a frame owned by another user passed"); without the size compare, the four wrong-size cases fail | **caught**. A file owned by another user takes root to make, so the test plays another user through the `kittyUID` seam |
| An `a=t` followed by one `a=p` with no cell count never showed: the refresh pass deleted the placement in the flush that sent it | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `forwardPlace` in `internal/app/kitty_passthrough_forward.go` back to sizing the record with `kp.calculateImageCells(cmd)` instead of `kp.placeCells(cmd, pixelW, pixelH)` (the tree before the fix) | `TestKittyPlaceAfterTransmitShows/b64`, `/shm`, `/daemon-b64` ("the image was placed 1 times, then taken down by `a=d,d=i,i=1,q=2` and never placed again") | **caught** (3 of 3) |

| The same, a PNG sent with `o=z` alone | n/a, injected | skip the `zlibbed` branch of `pngSize` | `TestKittyPlaceAfterTransmitShows/pngz` (same message); `/png` and `/daemon-png` pass | **caught** |
| The slowest client set the pace of a graphics pane: one stopped client froze the guest and every other client | n/a, injected | `everyClientBehind` in `internal/session/graphics_backpressure.go` returns true when any client is behind, and `maxGraphicsHold` back to 10 s, which is the design this PR started with | `TestKittyStuckClientDoesNotSlowTheOthers` ("the reading client got 8 frames while the other was stopped, 101 before", "the guest wrote 1 frames while a client was stopped, 180 before") | **caught** |
| A client that fell behind on a graphics pane queued every frame until its stream was cut | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `commitFrame` in `internal/session/kitty_frames.go` never drops the older frame | `TestKittyStuckClientDoesNotSlowTheOthers` ("the daemon cut 1 client streams", "the stopped client skipped no frames"); unit `TestStuckClientQueueStaysBounded`. main fails the same test with 1 delete and image data printed as text | **caught** |
| A graphics pane whose only client read in bursts was read at full speed, and the client printed image data | n/a, injected | `holdForSlowSubscribers` returns at once; main as well | `TestKittySlowClientHoldsTheGuest` ("the guest wrote 180 frames while its only client read in bursts, 180 while it read", "the daemon never held a pane"); on main also "image data was printed into the pane as text" | **caught** |
| A text pane was held like a graphics pane | n/a, injected | `streamsGraphics` returns true for every pane | `TestTextFloodPaneIsNeverHeld` ("the daemon held a pane that draws no graphics 3 times") | **caught** |
| A client attached, or resumed after a gap, inside a frame printed the rest of that frame's base64 as text | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `spanAt` block from `subscribeLocked` in `internal/session/session.go`; main as well | `TestKittyAttachDuringAStreamPrintsNoImageData` ("attach 2 of 8 printed image data into the pane as text"); each attach lands at a random point, so one run of 8 attaches passed: 16 attaches now. On main "attach 7 of 16" | **caught** (2 of 3 runs at 8 attaches) |

A first mutant changed only the verb and left the struct reading `window_size`, so it read nothing, fell back to the smallest wording and passed. The control now restores the whole function |

| A session row on a machine that answers is muted like one on a machine that does not, so the ink says less than the row does: a click on it attaches the session | n/a, injected, restores the ink this change replaced | `sidebarRemoteSessionRow` in `internal/app/sidebar_hosts.go` back to a flat `pal.FgMute` | unit `TestRailInksARemoteRowByItsLink` ("the row of a session on a machine that answers is not drawn in the resting ink") (since removed) | **caught in `internal/app`** |

| A rail too narrow for a name and a number keeps the number on a machine's rows and drops it on this machine's, so the same row type answers the width two ways | n/a, injected | drop `variant == sidebarVariantFull` from the count in `sidebarRemoteSessionRow` in `internal/app/sidebar_hosts.go` | an `internal/app` unit test failed ("a row on another machine keeps its count on a rail too narrow for one"), whose positive half was the same row carrying the count at the full variant; it was since removed, and not rerun against anything that replaced it | **caught in `internal/app` at the time; that test was removed** |
| The width never reaches the row: `drawHostRow` takes the variant and hands the row a constant | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | `drawHostRow` passes `sidebarVariantFull` to `sidebarRemoteSessionRow` instead of `variant` | the same removed unit test, which drove `drawHostRow` rather than the row function for this reason | **caught in `internal/app` at the time; that test was removed** |

| The reconnect tests read "@ local" to mean "this client is on build". The machine groups removed that row, so the three assertions were re-spelled as the rail's focus mark | n/a, see verdict | the two tests are each other's halves in one helper, which is rule 1 above: `TestALinkThatDropsIsDialedAgainAndThePaneComesBack` passes only while `home` is **not** marked current, and `TestAHostThatNeverComesBackGivesUpAndSaysWhy` passes only when it **is** | `TestAHostSessionStaysAttached` also fails on a mark that never moves, which `order-hoists-attached` and `fold-is-a-noop` above both demonstrate | **not weakened** |
| The review cursor stepped onto each wrapped row of a note, and only the row under it was drawn selected | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | `ReviewMove` in `internal/app/review_overlay.go` sets `r.cursor = min(max(r.cursor+delta, 0), len(rows)-1)` instead of calling `reviewStep` | `TestReviewWrappedNoteIsOneStop` ("j past the note: mark on row 5, want row 9") | **caught** |
| `attach --host NAME --ssh` with no `--command` sends a bare `tuios`, so a host whose tuios is only in `~/.local/bin` says "not found" | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `OpenArgs` in `internal/federation/open.go` sends `h.Command` (or `tuios` when it is empty) with the arguments instead of `h.remoteCommand(false, ...)`, so the probe never runs | `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHFindsTuiosOutsideThePath` ("the far tuios in ~/.local/bin never drew the session over --ssh: child exited (code 1)"); `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHRunsTheFarTuios` passes, correctly, since its host has a configured command | **caught** (macOS) |
| `attach --ssh` is ignored and the session is attached over the link, so the far tuios never runs | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | `runAttachOnHost(..., attachSSH)` in `cmd/tuios/main.go` passes `false` | `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHRunsTheFarTuios` ("no nested client for nested-target"), `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHFindsTuiosOutsideThePath` ("--ssh did not run the tuios found at .../far-home/.local/bin/tuios") | **caught** (macOS), and only since the process list is read with `ps`, see below |

With the old `pgrep -af` helper on macOS, `noNestedClient` stayed silent and the test failed 10 seconds later on an unrelated wait for the rail | **caught** (macOS), see below |
| On a one-line agent row the harness prefix was kept while two cells of the name were left, so a narrow rail read "claude/depl…" | whole change | build the tree before it (`a44708fe`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness` ("the rail cut the agent's name \"deploy\" to make room for its harness; agent rows: [\"│▎● claude/depl…\" ...]") | **caught** |
| The same, with only the call site cut | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | the `sidebarAgentPrefixRun` call in `sidebarAgentRow` (`internal/app/render_sidebar.go`) passes `min(nameW, 2)` instead of `nameW`, which is the old two-cell rule | `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness`, the same assertion. The unit test calls the function directly and does not see this cut | **caught** |
| The rail draws no prefix at all, which would pass the name half for the wrong reason | n/a, injected | the same call passes `nil` for the tokens | `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness` ("the rail never drew the short agent with its harness"), which is its positive half: `db` still has room for `claude/` | **caught** |
| A 16-column rail kept the word beside a machine's name and cut the name, so a header read "wo… offline" (issue 181) | whole change | build the tree before it (`07a467ca`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestTheNarrowRailNamesAMachineWhole/narrow` ("the rail cut the machine's name at width 16: \" ▾ wo…  offline│\""). The `wide` half passes on both builds, which is its job | **caught** |

| The harness prefix is budgeted like any other token, so it is kept beside a long name cut to its eight-cell keep | n/a, injected | `sidebarAgentBudget` in `internal/app/sidebar_agent_tokens.go` builds the prefix tokens with `Whole: false` | `TestNarrowRailKeepsWhatAnAgentIsDoing/shipped` ("the row kept a prefix beside a name it had cut: \"│▎● claude/deploy-the-a…\""). `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness` passes on this build: "deploy" is shorter than the keep, so the two rules agree on it | **caught** |
| `-w` took a unique id prefix before an exact name, so a pane named with hex digits ("db") was missed whenever another pane's uuid started with them: set-agent-state reported success and set the other pane. This was the "lost agent state" flake in `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness`, about 2 in 100 | n/a, the build before the fix | `findWindowStateIndex` in `internal/session/session_ops.go` as it was, trying the id prefix before the names | `TestAWindowNameWinsOverAnIdPrefix`, 3 of 3 runs ("the pane named \"d07e9a9b\" is at \"none\", want working"; "the pane whose id starts with ... took the state meant for the pane of that name").

| A client push carrying agent fields kept them over the daemon's, so a stale snapshot could put an old agent state back; the foreground command, shell pid, directory and machine were taken from the push the same way whenever it named one | n/a, the build before the fix | `retainDaemonExclusive` in `internal/session/state_merge.go` as it was. No E2E test reaches this: the TUI never sends these fields, so only a raw socket client could | the unit cases in `TestAClientSyncKeepsTheDaemonsWindowFields` ("a stale agent state in the push", "a stale foreground command, pid and directory in the push") and `TestTheMachineIsCarriedByWindow` ("named differently") all fail | **caught** (unit) |
| Teardown: a process that is still running passes the teardown check | n/a, injected into the fixture | the check is tuitest's own again, from 8db5fa3 on (pinned at 8912ebb), which counts a process in X as exited: every terminal starts through `tuitest.StartT`, and the `closeTerm` workaround that re-read its survivor list is gone. Rerun against `StartT` alone: a throwaway test starts `/bin/sh` with a child that calls `setsid` and takes root as its real uid through a setuid bit, so its owner cannot signal it. Linux container (golang:1.26), test run as an unprivileged user | "tuitest: ptyproc: 1 process(es) survived teardown: [2552]" on 8db5fa3 and "[2663]" on 8912ebb, and the test fails. Its positive half, the same shell with an ordinary `sleep` child, passes. The earlier run of this control against `closeTerm` failed `TestFocusAltArrowsPixelHostAddNoLine` the same way ("survived teardown: [1586465]"), and its positive half, 2000 teardowns under fork load with a process caught in X twice and passed, is what 8db5fa3 moved into tuitest | **caught** |
| The rail learned about another session's agent from the 3 second listing poll while the dock said it at once | n/a, injected | `foreignAgentRefreshCmd` in `internal/app/inbox.go` returns nil | `TestRailMarksAForeignAgentWhenTheDockDoes` ("the rail did not mark e2e-ask-a within 1.2s of its agent asking"), 3 of 3 runs | **caught** |
| A straight box-drawing line in a capture was two arms meeting mid-cell, so every row of a border had a notch | n/a, the build before the fix | `drawArms` in `internal/shot/boxdraw.go` without the one-rect case for two equal arms on one axis | `TestScreenshotDrawsAStraightBorderWithoutNotches` ("the stroke at x=8 loses ink at y=16: 417 against 556") | **caught** |
| On a light theme the rail and the dock wrote the dark ramp's near-white inks on the theme's near-white ground | n/a, injected | `GroundUI` in `internal/theme/ui.go` returns `UI()` unchanged | `TestLightThemeRailAndDockAreReadable` (session names and the dock notice at 1.09:1 against a 4.5:1 floor) | **caught** |
| An Inbox that opened empty and then filled kept the empty state's top, so the full list sat on the bottom edge | n/a, injected | `overlayAnchorY` in `internal/app/overlay_hit.go` returns the held top whenever the screen height is unchanged | `TestInboxThatFillsAfterOpeningIsCentred` ("13 rows above it and 1 below") | **caught** |
| The review footer kept a margin on its left only, so a key strip that fitted to the cell ran into the frame | n/a, injected | `reviewHints` in `internal/app/render_review.go` fits against `width-1` | `TestReviewFooterKeepsItsRightMargin` (footer ends "esc close│") | **caught** |
| The review's "too narrow for two columns" line stayed over the unified view it had recommended | n/a, injected | the `statusID` reset in `ReviewToggleSplit` disabled | `TestReviewNarrowSplitNoticeGoesWithTheSplit` (still on screen 2s after the second s) | **caught** |

| At 16 colours a workspace pill's fill is the terminal's own ground, and its caps were drawn in the default ink, so white half circles framed a label on nothing and read as brackets | whole fix | the wave01/final merge before the fix (`workspacePill` without its `overlay.IsNoColor(ground)` branch), pointed to by `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` | `TestChromeAtEveryColourDepth` dark-16 and light-16 ("pill cap ... is drawn in the default ink"); the 256 and truecolor runs pass on both builds, which is their positive half | **caught** |
| At 16 colours a chip on a light slot took the light ink: the PREFIX badge was slot 15 on slot 3, which a light theme paints close to its own ground, because `ContrastText` measured a slot as the dim VGA colour | whole fix | the build before the fix (`ContrastText` without `slotAsXTerm`), pointed to by `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` | `TestOverlayLayouts` dark-120x40-16 and light-120x40-16 ("is slot 15 on slot 3: light ink on a light ground"); the 256 and truecolor runs pass on both builds, which is their positive half | **caught** |

| A saturated colour stepped down to 256 landed on a grey: `colorprofile` places Catppuccin Latte's red on 241, so a removed line's number was grey | n/a, injected | `overlay.To256` returns `colorprofile.ANSI256.Convert(c)` instead of `nearest256(c)` | `TestReviewDiffAtEveryColourDepth/light-256` ("the removed line's number is drawn in ...

Positive half: the subtest asserts the object is still there after SIGKILL ends the stand-in | **caught** |
| `TestKittyStandInShmRemovedAfterTest` looked for the object once, right after the stand-in reported its geometry. The stand-in creates the object after that report, so the test failed when it looked first (main, run 37220244828) | n/a, injected | in `e2e/tui/frameloop/main.go`, sleep one second between `report` and `allocate`; run the test as it was | `TestKittyStandInShmRemovedAfterTest` ("the stand-in made no object with prefix"), the same message as CI. With the condition wait: passes with the delay, and 10 of 10 without it | **caught** |
| A pane that asked for releases got a press with no release while the host sent none (no protocol, or the moment before the host switched flags), so a compositor in the pane held the key and its client repeated it | whole change, then the call site | build `origin/main` (`4e689aa1`); then drop the `rawInput = append(rawInput, releaseNow...)` line in `internal/input/keyboard_terminal.go` | `TestPaneGetsReleaseTheHostCannotSend` ("the pane received `\x1b[120u`", the press alone) both times; positive half `TestPaneGetsRepeatAsRepeat`, where the host sends the release and the pane gets exactly one | **caught** |

| The lock modifiers were dropped for a pane that asked for every key, so a compositor in it could not learn that Num Lock was on | whole change, then the gate | `origin/main`; then make the report-all-keys gate in `kittyModParamFor` always return early | `TestPaneGetsLockState` both times; the negative half (no lock bits under disambiguate) is the `internal/vt` case `up, numlock on, has no lock bits` | **caught** |
| A multifocus peer got the focused pane's bytes, so a shell peer got kitty releases as text ("1:3u: command not found") | the call site | send `rawInput` to each peer instead of `paneKeyBytes(host, w, o, false)` in `internal/input/keyboard_terminal.go`; also the build before the change | `TestMultifocusPeerGetsItsOwnEncoding` (the shell never printed PEER-42) both times | **caught** |
| The leader pressed twice sent a press with no release | the call site | drop the release from the `paneKeyBytes` result in `forwardKeyToFocusedWindow`; also the build before the change | `TestLeaderTwiceGetsItsRelease` (the pane received the press alone) both times | **caught** |
| Enter, Tab and Backspace got CSI u and a release under event types without report-all-keys | the gate | remove the `isKittyLegacyTextKey` checks in `internal/vt/kitty_keyboard.go`; also the build before the change | `TestNoReleaseForEnterWithoutAllKeys`; unit `TestEncoderMatchesKitty` (49 and 13 mismatches against kitty's encoder) | **caught** |

| `agent-statusline` panicked with SIGSEGV when the daemon could not be dialed (issue #374): the dial closure returned a typed-nil `*VerbClient` and the deferred close called `Close` on it | whole change | build `origin/main` (`3f8df65b`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestStatusLineWithADeadDaemonStillRenders`, all four cases (missing and stale socket, with and without a named pane): "exit status 2", "panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" | **caught** (4 of 4 run). Three layers each stop the crash on their own: the closures return an untyped nil, `reportStatusLine` assigns the client only after a good dial, and `Close` is safe on a nil receiver |
| A built-in theme with no cursor colour (horizon and 11 others) put a nil `*tint.Color` into a `color.Color`, so an OSC 12 query in a pane and `tuios list-themes horizon` panicked. Found in the #374 sweep | whole change | build `origin/main` (`3f8df65b`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestOSC12QueryUnderAThemeWithNoCursorColour/horizon` (the shell marker never came, the client died), `TestListThemesDescribesAThemeWithNoCursorColour` ("list-themes horizon failed: failed to read response: EOF"). The `dracula` halves pass on both builds, and are the positive half | **caught** |
| The emulator gets the theme's nil cursor as a non-nil `color.Color` again | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `TerminalCursor` in `internal/theme/theme.go` returns `t.Cursor` instead of `AsColor(t.Cursor)` | `TestOSC12QueryUnderAThemeWithNoCursorColour/horizon`; `/dracula` passes. `TestListThemesDescribesAThemeWithNoCursorColour` passes, and that is correct: `Describe` has its own guard | **caught** |
| The width keys sent with send-keys resized the PTYs and left the tiles at equal shares: `RemoteKeysDoneMsg` dropped the workspace's BSP tree and tiled it again from nothing | the call site (the fix only deletes it) | build `origin/main` (`11335985`), which still has the rebuild | `TestWidthPercentAfterAClose` (screen two halves, daemon 32 and 128 columns), `TestWidthPercentWithNoClose` (the same with three panes). Positive half: `TestWidthPercentFromTheKeyboard`, the same keys on the client's keyboard, passes on both builds | **caught** |
| An active Neovim pane could move focus with an unsolicited OSC request | n/a, injected | remove `!m.matchesPendingNvimNavigation(msg)` from the rejection condition in `internal/app/nvim_navigation.go` | `TestNvimNavigationOSCNeedsForwardedKey` ("active pane moved focus ... without a forwarded key") | **caught** |
| A switch to an empty workspace sent no focus-out, so the pane read two focus-ins in a row | the focus reports by window id | build the PR's own focus report commit (`ea43bbfb`), which reports only inside `FocusWindow` | `TestPaneFocusEventsFollowTheFocus` ("switch to an empty workspace: the pane read `^[[O^[[I`, want `^[[O^[[I^[[O`") | **caught** |

| A Crush command that scrolls in its dialog is allowed on one press, its risk unseen | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `harness.PartialSuffix` check from `riskOfLine` in `internal/session/approval_risk.go` | `TestCrushRiskyCommandTakesTwoPresses` ("the approval is not marked cut short"); the PR head before the fix fails it too (the message was the description, "approve bash: Install the tool") | **caught** |

A first version passed under both controls: in a short pane the shell's output after the kill scrolled the dialog off, and a pane with no dialog clears by another route. The test now runs in a tiled pane and checks that the dialog is still on the screen | **caught** |

| A pane on a hidden workspace stayed listed after its program exited: the daemon sent PTYClosed to subscribed clients only, and a client streams only the shown workspace | the call site | put the `cs.ptySubscriptions[ptyID]` check back in `notifyPTYClosed` | `TestAPaneOnAHiddenWorkspaceClosesWhenItsProgramExits` (the session still lists the pane after 15 s). Positive half: the pane is listed before it exits. `TestAPaneShownByFocusWindowStreamsItsOutput` passes on this build | **caught** |
| focus-window on a pane on a hidden workspace showed it blank, and its kitty frames never reached the host: a workspace switch adopted from a state sync did not subscribe the panes it brought on screen | the call site | drop the `m.reconcilePaneStreams()` call at the end of `ApplyStateSyncFrom` | `TestAPaneShownByFocusWindowStreamsItsOutput` (neither EARLYMARK nor LIVEMARK shows). `TestAPaneOnAHiddenWorkspaceClosesWhenItsProgramExits` passes on this build. Both tests also fail on `origin/main` (`11335985`) | **caught** |
| A long message was cut in the dock with no way to read the rest, and the log viewer cut it too or did not hold it (#381) | whole change | build `origin/main` (`e1af811a`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestLongNotificationOpensInFull` ("hovering the cut message showed no label", "a click on the cut message did not show its end"), `TestLogViewerShowsALongEntryInFull` ("the log viewer does not list the long message"), `TestMessageViewScrolls` ("prefix N did not open the message"), `TestHoverHoldsAMessage` ("the message burned down under the pointer"), `TestLongNoSpaceMessageKeepsTheClientResponsive`, `TestViewersOverTheRailAndTheLeader`. `TestClipboardAskIsAllowedByAClick` and `TestKeyPressEndsTheHold` pass on main, which is correct: they guard regressions the first version of this change brought in | **caught** |

| The first version of the #381 change, before review: a click on a clipboard ask opened the view, which cannot allow it; an 8000 byte OSC 9 with no spaces froze the client; a key press did not end the hover hold; the rail kept the view's keys; a paste reached the pane under the view; the leader was swallowed | that review's fixes | build the PR head before them (`c2e76b45`) | `TestClipboardAskIsAllowedByAClick` ("a click on the ask did not allow the write"), `TestLongNoSpaceMessageKeepsTheClientResponsive` ("the message view did not open in time"), `TestKeyPressEndsTheHold` ("the message stayed after a key press"), `TestViewersOverTheRailAndTheLeader` (leader, paste and rail steps) | **caught** |

| The 512 byte cap on a notification's text | n/a, injected | drop `capText` from `showNotification` and from the pane path in `internal/app/notify.go` | none. Correct: the linear `wrapPlain` and the wrap cache keep an 8000 byte message fast on their own. The cap bounds memory and the log | **not caught alone** |

### The mouse row is a whole-change control, not a single-hunk one

The mouse tests were written against a change whose whole point is a different
interaction, not against a bug with one faulty line, so the control is the
merge-base binary rather than a hunk revert:

```sh
git worktree add --detach /tmp/negctl origin/main
(cd /tmp/negctl && go build -o /tmp/tuios-main ./cmd/tuios)
cd e2e/tui && TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-main go test -count=1 \
  -run 'TestWheel|TestTypingWhileScrolled|TestMouseTracking|TestDragSelection|TestDoubleClick' -timeout 900s .
```

Each failure names the old behaviour: "COPY MODE" on the dock during a scroll,
`echo` never producing its marker because the keystrokes were eaten as vim
motions, and an empty list of clipboard writes because a drag moved the window
instead of selecting.

### Why the two blank-pane and torn-buffer entries are not caught, and what does cover them

**The blank-frame cache (`11a0023`)** needs a render to land in the gap between
a full-screen application clearing the alternate screen and painting it. Once
the application does paint, that output re-marks the window dirty and the pane
repairs itself, so a black-box observer sees the correct screen either way.
Widening the gap artificially does not help: during a deliberately long gap the
pane is legitimately blank on the fixed build too, so there is nothing to
distinguish. The fix's own commit message says the same thing, and its tests
assert on `renderTerminal`'s output and on the cache directly for exactly this
reason. Coverage lives in `internal/app/blank_alt_screen_cache_test.go`.

**The unlocked emulator resize (`fd1463e`)** is a data race. It corrupts the
cell buffer only when a state sync lands mid-write or mid-render, which needs
the race detector on tuios's own goroutines to observe reliably. This package
runs tuios as a child process, so `-race` on the test binary instruments the
harness and not the program under test. Coverage lives in
`internal/app/state_sync_race_test.go`, which floods a daemon window while
applying geometry-changing state syncs under `-race`.

**The shutdown WaitGroup race** is a data race in the daemon. A subscribe
writes its ack and then starts the event streamer on the daemon's WaitGroup.
A client that read the ack and stopped the daemon at once made that `Add` run
concurrently with shutdown's `Wait`. The same reason as above keeps it out of
this suite. Coverage lives in
`internal/session/shutdown_waitgroup_test.go`
(`TestSubscribeDuringStopRegistersNoGoroutine`), run under `-race`. The control
put `d.wg.Go` back at the call site in `startPendingStream`, with the
`goTracked` helper left in place. The test failed in 20 of 20 runs with the
call site cut and passed in 20 of 20 with the fix.

Those are genuine gaps in *this* suite, not in the project's coverage.
The general lesson is that end-to-end screen assertions are the right tool for
bugs whose symptom is a wrong screen that persists, and the wrong tool for bugs
whose symptom is a narrow timing window or a memory race.

## Why the two-client chrome test catches nothing

Since the rail became session state, a current second client shows the rail
with the first, so the test runs its second client with
`TUIOS_SIDEBAR_LEGACY=1`, as a build from before that. Chrome that differs
between two clients is still possible against an older client, and the test
still guards that case.

`TestOneClientsRailDoesNotMoveAnotherClientsPanes` was written expecting to fail
with the agreed layout reserve removed, and it does not. It is kept as a
deliberate passes-both-ways control, and the reason is worth having written
down, because it says what this harness can and cannot see about multi-client
layout.

With the reserve removed, the two clients still reach the same frame, by
fighting to it. The client with the rail reads the other's rectangles as a
layout for somebody else's screen, works out its own and pushes it; the client
without one reads what comes back as settled, because a layout that sits inside
a wider box and still reaches its far edges cannot be told from one that belongs
there. So the wider client always yields and the frames converge.

What that convergence costs is not on the grid: each round trip resizes the
shared PTYs twice, once to the pushed rectangles and once back. That is what
damages scrollback, and it was counted rather than looked at by two
`internal/app` unit tests, which failed with the reserve removed (four resizes
per pane switch, and the two clients running the same shells at different
sizes). Both have since been removed; `TestSessionHoldsOneSizeForTwoClients`,
`TestGeometryConfigDisagreementDoesNotMovePanes` and the `internal/app`
convergence harness (`TestMultiClientConvergence`) now cover two clients
agreeing on pane sizes, and the reserve-removed mutation has not been rerun
against them. The frame test guards the property a resize count cannot see:
that what the two people are looking at is the same layout. It would catch a change that bought
the resizes back by letting the frames drift apart.

## The two mouse controls that were invisible until the helpers were fixed

Both rows marked "invisible before this change" were measured, not reasoned
about. The procedure for each: build a binary with the fault, run the **old**
helpers against it (the `origin/main` copy of `e2e/tui`), then the **new** ones.

```sh
git worktree add --detach /tmp/negctl origin/main
# inject one fault in /tmp/negctl, then
(cd /tmp/negctl && go build -o /tmp/tuios-fault ./cmd/tuios)

# old helpers
cd /tmp/negctl/e2e/tui && TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-fault go test -count=1 -run '<tests>' .
# new helpers
cd e2e/tui           && TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-fault go test -count=1 -run '<tests>' .
```

**Eager clipboard copy.** Old helpers: `TestDoubleClickCopiesAWordAndTripleClickTheLine`
and `TestDragSelectionCopiesOnRelease` both PASS. New helpers: the multi-click
test FAILS on the stray write. `clickAt` used to send n presses and one trailing
release, so the release that follows the first click of a gesture was never
generated and nothing that happens on it could be observed; and
`waitForClipboard` asked only whether the wanted text was somewhere in the list
of writes, which cannot see a write that should not be there. The gesture now
asserts its whole sequence of writes: none for a single click, one for a double,
two for a triple, because a triple passes through the word on its way to the
line and each release is a real release.

**A click that freezes every pane.** Old helpers: all thirteen mouse and
context-menu tests PASS. New helpers: `TestClickInPaneDoesNotFreezeOutput`
FAILS, waiting the full 20s for output that never arrives. `leftClick` and
`shiftRightClick` sent a press and no release at all, and a left press inside a
pane sets `OS.Dragging`, which makes `app.updateTerminals` return early: while
it is set tuios stops polling every pane. Sending this test's click press-only
against a *correct* binary reproduces the same 20s timeout, which is the
measurement that the old shape was not a smaller version of a real gesture but a
state no user can reach.

## The ssh fallback tests failed on every Mac, and the cause was pgrep

`TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHFindsTuiosOutsideThePath` and
`TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHRunsTheFarTuios` passed on linux CI and failed on
every macOS run with "--ssh did not run the tuios found at ...". The product
was working: both tests had already seen the far tuios draw the session, and
failed only on the check after it, which proves which program drew it.

That check ran `pgrep -af PATTERN` and searched the output for a command line.
On linux (procps) `-a` means "print the full command line". On macOS and the
BSDs `-a` means "include the ancestors of each match", and pgrep prints bare
pids unless it is also given `-l`. So on a Mac the output held numbers and
nothing else, the positive assertions in those two tests could never pass, and
the negative assertion in `noNestedClient` (`host_attach_test.go`) could never
fail. The last one is the worse half: `TestAttachOnAHostIsDrawnByThisClient`
guards against a nested client and, on a Mac, would have let one through.

The three call sites now use `commandLinesContaining` in `harness_test.go`,
which reads `ps -A -ww -o args=`. That prints every process's untruncated
command line on both systems. The three rows above were run on macOS against
the fixed helper; each also passes on the unmodified build.

## The agent switch, `[agents] enabled = false`

`agents_off_test.go` was run against a build of origin/main, which has no
switch, and against this branch with one call site cut at a time.

| get-config reads the switch | `verbGetOption`: the `agents.enabled` branch cut | `TestAgentsOffGetConfigSaysOff` (prints `true` with source `default` while every agent verb is refused) | **caught** |

Two fixes have no end-to-end test. Each closes a race that a test cannot
time:
- A `request-approval` admitted just before the switch goes off now closes
  its own hold.
- A detection pass that read the switch before it went off clears what it
  wrote.

The section editor and the length of the notice have no test.

The client rail gate is not caught because the daemon reads the same file
and holds no agent state, so the rail has nothing to list either way. The
gate matters only for a client whose config differs from its daemon's, which
this suite does not set up.

## max_fps up to 240, and auto

Each control cut one line, built the binary, and ran `TestMaxFPS` (the frame
rate test with `TUIOS_E2E_PERF=1`).

| Wiring | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The cap | `MaxFPSCap` back to 120 | `TestMaxFPSLoadsAndShows` (list-options says 120, the row never shows 240), `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` (the row never shows `Auto (144)`) | **caught** |
| Detection at startup | `BindProgram`: the `detectDisplayRate` call cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` (the row never shows `Auto (144)`) | **caught** |
| The answer reaching the model | `Update`: the `displayRateMsg` case cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` | **caught** |
| No detection over SSH | `Detect`: the `Local` check cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` (the SSH client shows `Auto (144)`, not `Auto (60)`; the local client is the positive half) | **caught** |
| Binding the attached client | `session_commands.go`: the `BindProgram` call cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` | **caught** |
| A save writes a number bare and auto quoted | `MarshalUserConfig`: `EnableMarshalerInterface` cut | `TestMaxFPSLoadsAndShows` (the file never has `max_fps = 240`) | **caught** |
| The detected rate reaching the ticker | `handleDisplayRate`: the `applyFrameRate` call cut | `TestMaxFPS240DrawsPastTheOldClamp` (auto on a 240 Hz display draws 60 frames a second) | **caught** |
| The 120 clamp lifted | build origin/main and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestMaxFPS240DrawsPastTheOldClamp` (max_fps 240 draws 120 frames a second) | **caught** |

The frame rate test needs a machine that composes a frame in well under 4 ms,
so it runs only with `TUIOS_E2E_PERF` set. The served-client gate in
`detectsDisplay` (`ClientLocal`) has no control: the suite cannot run an SSH
server client next to a desktop.

## wait-for window-output slowed a flooding pane

A pending `wait-for window-output` captured the whole scrollback on every
output event. A flooding pane raises one event per PTY read. The perf budget
for this is a unit test in `internal/session`, because it times the daemon's
emulator and not a client. It runs the same flood with and without a waiter
in one fixture, so the run without the waiter is its positive half.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A capture per output event | `waitWindowOutput` in `internal/session/verb_subscribe.go`: the `waitOutputMinGap` coalescing cut, so the `sub.ch` case calls `matches()` on every event | `TestWaitForOutputDoesNotSlowFlood` ("a pending wait-for made the flood 3.37x slower", then 3.27x and 3.57x, against 0.92x to 0.98x with the fix) | **caught in `internal/session`** (3 of 3 run) |

## The tmux shim: prefixes, formats and the commands tools send

Each test in `tmux_shim_compat_test.go` writes the `tuios tmux` calls it made
and their output to `transcript.txt` in its artifact directory. The bug
fixes were cut at their call sites, one build each. The new commands were
checked against origin/main (a640011), which answers each of them with
`unknown command`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No change at all | build origin/main and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | all nine `TestTmuxShim*` tests in the file: `show-option`, `wait-for`, `run-shell`, `show-buffer`, `last-pane` and `display-popup` are unknown commands, `pane_pid` is empty, `select-pane -L` needs a client, and the control client answers for `e2e-ctrlp` | **caught** (9 of 9) |
| Command prefixes | `lookupCommand`: a name matches only when it is the whole word | `TestTmuxShimCommandPrefixes` (`unknown command: show-option`) | **caught** |
| pane_pid and pane_tty | `addOnePaneMeta`: the `pid` and `tty` lines cut | `TestTmuxShimPaneFormats` (`pane_pid = ""`) | **caught** |
| history-limit printed `""` | `historyLimit`: the string case cut and `""` returned when the daemon does not say, as before | `TestTmuxShimPaneFormats` (`history-limit = ""`) | **caught** |
| select-pane direction on a detached session, and from the target | `selectPane`: the `selectDirection` call replaced by the old `focus-window` direction call | `TestTmuxShimMovesPanes` (needs an attached client), `TestTmuxShimSelectPaneDirection` (`no window right of the focused one`) | **caught** (2 of 2) |
| Control mode used the wrong session | `runControl`: the `s.attached = c.session` line cut | `TestTmuxShimControlModeTargetsItsSession` (answers for `e2e-ctrlp`) | **caught** |
| set-environment reaches new panes | `splitWindow`: `paneEnvFor` cut from the pane's environment | `TestTmuxShimBuffersAndEnvironment` (the pane sees `/`) | **caught** |

`TestExpandMatchesTmux` in `internal/tmuxcompat` is the wire-compatibility
table for the format language: every expected string is what tmux 3.4
printed for the same format and values. It has no e2e counterpart.

## Pane input encoding: mouse forms, modifyOtherKeys, kitty flags per screen

Each control removed one fix from the current tree, built the binary, and ran
the named test, standalone and against a daemon. Each test has a positive
half in the same fixture: the SGR step for the mouse forms, the plain and
kitty steps for modifyOtherKeys, and the main-screen step for the kitty flags.

| Fix | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mouse reports in the X10, UTF-8 (1005) and urxvt (1015) forms | `mouseReport.encode` in `internal/vt/mouse_encode.go`: every non-SGR encoding sent through the old `ansi.MouseX10` call | `TestPaneMouseReportEncoding/standalone` and `/daemon`: the x10 step reads column 101 as UTF-8 and column 231 as BEL, the utf8 and urxvt steps read the X10 form. The sgr step passes | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| modifyOtherKeys reaching the pane | `paneKeyBytes` in `internal/input/pane_key.go`: the `EncodeModifyOtherKeys` call cut | `TestPaneModifyOtherKeys/standalone` and `/daemon`: the level1 and level2 steps read the legacy bytes. The plain and kitty steps pass | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| A kitty flag stack for each screen | `setAltScreenMode` in `internal/vt/csi_mode.go`: the `SetAltScreen` call cut | `TestPaneKittyFlagsPerScreen/standalone` and `/daemon`: the alt step reads `CSI 97 ; 5 u`. The main step passes | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| modifyOtherKeys turned off while the pane is hidden | `ApplyTerminalState` in `internal/session/session.go`: the `ModifyOtherKeysKnown` term cut, so only a level above 0 is restored | `TestPaneModifyOtherKeysOffWhileHidden`: the pane reads `CSI 27 ; 5 ; 97 ~`, want `0x01`. `TestPaneKittyMainStackAcrossAttach` passes | **caught** (1 of 1 run) |
| The main screen's kitty stack across an attach under the alternate screen | `ApplyTerminalState` in `internal/session/session.go`: the `RestoreKittyKeyboardMainStack` call cut | `TestPaneKittyMainStackAcrossAttach`: the pane reads `0x01`, want `CSI 97 ; 5 u`. `TestPaneModifyOtherKeysOffWhileHidden` passes | **caught** (1 of 1 run) |
| The 1005 form writes a button of 128 or more (back, forward) as UTF-8, as xterm does | `mouseReport.encode` in `internal/vt/mouse_encode.go`: the button written as one raw byte again | unit `TestConform_MouseEncoding` ("UTF-8 form, the back button is UTF-8" and "forward with ctrl"). The X10 back button case passes, its positive half | **caught in `internal/vt`** |

## Turn checkpoints and undo

Each test in `checkpoint_test.go` writes the `tuios` calls it made and their
output to `transcript.txt` in its artifact directory. Each control cut one
call site from the current tree, built a binary, and ran the named test
against it.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No checkpoint at the end of a turn | the session event sink: the `noteCheckpointEvent` call cut | `TestCheckpointUndoesATurn` ("after turn 1 the pane has 0 checkpoints, want 1") | **caught** |
| No safety checkpoint before a restore | `verbRestoreCheckpoint`: the safety `SaveCheckpoint` call replaced by the newest checkpoint | `TestCheckpointUndoesATurn` (the restore names checkpoint 2 as the undo, and the list has no safety checkpoint 3) | **caught** |
| The restore uses the person's index | `RestoreTree`: the temporary `GIT_INDEX_FILE` dropped from `read-tree` and `checkout-index` | `TestCheckpointUndoesATurn` (the index holds `notes.txt` after the restore) | **caught** |
| A removed worktree keeps its checkpoints | `verbRemoveWorktree`: the `dropCheckpointsOf` call cut | `TestCheckpointsGoWithTheirWorktree` (both refs are still there) | **caught** |
| A restore writes over an ignored file | `RestoreTree`: the `blockingPath` check absent (the tree before the fix) | `TestCheckpointRestoreKeepsIgnoredFiles` (the restore succeeds, and `.env` holds turn 1's text) | **caught** |
| A refused restore keeps its safety checkpoint | `verbRestoreCheckpoint`: the `DeleteCheckpoints` call cut from the `OverwriteError` refusal | `TestCheckpointRestoreKeepsIgnoredFiles` (the list holds a safety checkpoint 3 after a refusal that says nothing was changed) | **caught** |
| A large untracked file in a checkpoint | `SaveCheckpoint`: snapshots with no exclusions and records nothing left out (the tree before the change) | `TestCheckpointLeavesOutLargeUntrackedFiles` (the 2 MiB file is in the diff and the object store, and the list names nothing) | **caught** |

The positive halves are in the same tests: the refused restore while the
agent works runs after restores that succeed, and the main checkout's
checkpoint stays after the worktree's goes. The pruning to `keep` and the
refusal of a checkpoint taken in another work tree have no end-to-end test.

## Copy-mode search columns in the scrollback

Copy-mode search now reads the history as text cells and takes a match's
columns from the cells. It used to count runes as columns, so a cell of
several runes before a match moved the cursor right of it. The ASCII needle
in the same fixture is the positive half: the column check passes on both
builds for a line of one rune a cell. The memory budgets for the search and
for the history save are unit tests in `internal/input` and
`internal/session`, because they measure bytes and not a screen.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search columns counted in runes | whole change: build the tree before it and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestCopyModeSearchColumnInScrollback` ("needle-cm: the copy cursor is at row 10 column 40, want the match's column 36"); the `needle-ascii` half passes | **caught** |
| A search key decoded every history line | whole change, same build | unit `TestCopyModeSearchKeyBudget` ("one search key allocated 258.1 MB, the budget is 4 MB") | **caught in `internal/input`** |
| A history save decoded its rows under the pane's lock | whole change, same build | unit `TestHistoryCaptureBudget` ("the capture allocated 24.7 MB under the pane's lock, the budget is 4 MB") | **caught in `internal/session`** |
| The line cache bounded by its line count only | whole change, same build | unit `TestScrollbackCacheIsBounded` ("cache holds 102400 decoded cells after a walk of a 400-column ring, want at most 65536") | **caught in `internal/vt`** |

## Push notifications for the Inbox, `[notify]`

Each control cut one call site from the current tree, built the binary, and
ran `TestNotify` (the four tests in `notify_test.go`). The fake provider is
an HTTP server in the test process that stands in for ntfy, Pushover and a
webhook. Each test has its positive half in the same fixture: the first test
proves the line changed (`list-attention` shows the new line) before it counts
that nothing more was sent, the quiet test sends an approval after the client
left, and the held test sends the held approval itself.

`TestNotifyPushesAnApprovalNobodyIsLookingAt` sets `cooldown_seconds = 0`.
With the default cooldown of 60 seconds, the de-dupe control passed: the
cooldown for the same pane and kind held back the second send on its own, so
the test did not reach the per-item check it names. With no cooldown the
per-item check is the only thing in the way, and the control fails.

| Fix | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The daemon sends a notification for an Inbox item | `d.notify.start()` in `Daemon.Start` (`internal/session/daemon.go`) | `TestNotifyPushesAnApprovalNobodyIsLookingAt` (no request after the approval), `TestNotifyHoldsWhileAPersonTypesAtAClient` (no request after the person left), and `TestNotifySendsAHeldItemWhenThePersonStaysAway` (no request after the quiet time) | **caught** (3 of 3) |
| One notification per item | `if n.sent[it.ID] { return }` in `pushNotifier.note` | `TestNotifyPushesAnApprovalNobodyIsLookingAt`: 6 requests after the repeated reports and the changed line, want 3 | **caught** (with `cooldown_seconds = 0`; not caught at the default cooldown, see above) |
| Quiet while a person types at a client | the quiet test in `pushNotifier.considerLocked` made false | `TestNotifyHoldsWhileAPersonTypesAtAClient`: 3 requests while the client was active, want 0 | **caught** |
| A key typed into a pane counts as activity | `cs.lastInput.Store(...)` in `Daemon.handleInput` (`internal/session/daemon_handlers.go`) | `TestNotifyHoldsWhileAPersonTypesAtAClient`: 3 requests while the client was active, want 0 | **caught** |
| A held item is sent when the person stays away | `n.armLocked(...)` in `pushNotifier.considerLocked` | `TestNotifySendsAHeldItemWhenThePersonStaysAway`: no request after the quiet time | **caught** |
| A notification's link opens the Inbox in tuios-web | `daemonOpts.OpenInboxItem = sessionInboxItem(...)` in `createTUIOSHandler` (`cmd/tuios-web/main.go`) | `TestNotificationLinkOpensTheInboxOnItsItem` in `cmd/tuios-web` (main module, run with `go test`): the browser with the cookie never shows the Inbox. Its positive half is the browser with no cookie, which shows no Inbox | **caught** |
| Notifications need no curl | whole change: build the tree with the curl `internal/pushnotify/send.go` and `pushnotify.go` and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestNotifyNeedsNoCurl` ("after the approval, with no curl: want 1 request per provider, got ntfy 0, pushover 0, webhook 0"). The other three `TestNotify` tests pass on that build, since curl is on PATH for them. Positive half: the same test passes on the net/http build | **caught** |

The test of a secret in the daemon log reads `daemon.log` at
`TUIOS_LOG_LEVEL=trace` and first checks that the log records the ntfy send,
so a log that is empty or in another place fails it. No control injects a
secret into the log. `TestNotifySecretsStayOutOfDumps` in `internal/config`
is the unit test of the redaction itself. It caught a real leak while it was
written: fmt prints a pointer field with `%s` or `%q` through its error path,
which skips `String` and `Format`, so a token in `[notify.ntfy]` printed whole.
The provider tables now format themselves.

## Shipping a worktree: commit, merge, push, pull request

The tests in `ship_test.go` use a throwaway repository with a bare
repository as its origin, a fake `gh` on `PATH` that records its arguments
and answers with canned JSON, and a fake `gpg` that signs anything. Each
writes its `tuios` calls to `transcript.txt`, and the main test writes the
fake `gh`'s calls to `gh-calls.txt`. Each control cut one line from the
current tree, built a binary, and ran the named test against it.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A conflicting merge left in place | `abortMerge`: the `git reset --merge` call cut | `TestShipFromWorktreeToPullRequest` (the main checkout changed, is not clean, has `MERGE_HEAD`, and README holds conflict markers) | **caught** |
| A push without a confirmation | `shipOutboundGate`: the confirm token check made false | `TestShipFromWorktreeToPullRequest` ("the unconfirmed push reached the origin: refs/heads/feat/ship") | **caught** |
| The poll not started on attach | `handleAttach`: the `kickPRPoll` call cut | `TestShipFromWorktreeToPullRequest` (the badge stays `PR #7 open pending` after gh says the checks passed) | **caught** |
| A commit that is not the person's | `CommitAll`: the commit run with the checkpoint identity and `--no-gpg-sign` | `TestShipFromWorktreeToPullRequest` (the commit is by `tuios`, and has no `gpgsig`) | **caught** |
| A push from a pane with no question | `shipCallerIsPerson`: answers true for every caller | `TestShipPushFromAPaneAsksThePerson` (the wait for the Inbox question times out, and the push has already gone out) | **caught** |
| A push sends the branch as it is after the question | `worktree.Push`: pushes `refs/heads/<branch>` instead of the resolved commit (the tree before the fix) | `TestShipPushSendsTheCommitThePersonAllowed` (the origin gets the commit made after the question was put) | **caught** |
| The question names only the remote | `shipQuestion`: asks "to origin?" with no address (the tree before the change) | `TestShipPushQuestionNamesWhereThePushGoes` (the wait for `elsewhere.example/someone/else.git` in the question times out) | **caught** |
| `fan keep --merge` that does not merge | `verbKeepFan`: the `if p.Merge` block made false | `TestFanKeepMergesTheKeptAttempt` (the keep into a dirty main checkout is not refused) | **caught** |

The positive halves are in the same tests: the commit refused while the
agent works is followed by one that succeeds, the push refused without a
confirmation is followed by one with `--yes` that reaches the origin, the
conflicting and dirty merges follow a fast-forward that lands, and the
refused keep is followed by one that merges. A push that is not a
fast-forward, a squash or ff-only merge, a pull request that is already
open, and gh missing or not logged in have no end-to-end test.

## The way out of the spotlight

People who turned the spotlight on by mistake saw a short message and then a
dimmed screen with no way out on it. The dock now shows a Spotlight chip with
the key that turns it off. Esc turns it off in window mode. In terminal mode
esc stays with the program, and leader, B turns it off. A click on the chip
turns it off in any mode. The window-mode key moved from `b` to `B`.

All seven tests in `spotlight_exit_test.go` fail on origin/main at b0cd61cb,
because that build draws no chip. For `TestEscReachesTheProgramWhileTheSpotlightIsOn`
that failure is only the positive half: esc already reached the pane there. The
injected controls below change one call site each from the current tree, built the
binary, and ran the named tests.

| Fix | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Esc turns the spotlight off in window mode | the `TurnOffSpotlight` call in the esc block of `HandleWindowManagementModeKey` (`internal/input/keyboard_wm.go`) | `TestEscTurnsTheSpotlightOffInWindowMode`, `TestEscClosesAnOverlayBeforeTheSpotlight` ("did not turn the spotlight off") | **caught** |
| An open overlay takes esc before the spotlight | the esc check moved to the top of `HandleWindowManagementModeKey`, ahead of the overlays | `TestEscClosesAnOverlayBeforeTheSpotlight` ("esc did not close the palette") | **caught** |
| A click on the chip turns the spotlight off | the `SpotlightChipAt` branch in the dock click path (`internal/input/mouse_click.go`) | `TestClickingTheSpotlightChipTurnsItOff` | **caught** |
| Leader, B turns it off in terminal mode | the `prefix_toggle_spotlight` default binding (`internal/config/userconfig.go`) | `TestTheLeaderChordTurnsTheSpotlightOffInTerminalMode` (the chip says "click turn off", and the chord does nothing) | **caught** |
| Esc in terminal mode reaches the program | esc in `keyboard_terminal.go` turns the spotlight off and is not forwarded, which is what a double-esc exit does to the second esc | `TestEscReachesTheProgramWhileTheSpotlightIsOn` ("the two escs did not reach cat -v") | **caught** |
| A single esc in terminal mode reaches the program without delay | `HandleTerminalModeKey` (`internal/input/keyboard_terminal.go`) sleeps 300 ms on esc while the spotlight is on, which is the hold a double-esc exit needs | `TestEscReachesTheProgramWhileTheSpotlightIsOn` ("a single esc took 365ms to reach the pane, a plain key 16ms; esc is held back") | **caught** |
| The chip is not dimmed | `applySpotlight` passes no lit spans (`internal/app/spotlight.go`) | `TestSpotlightKeyShowsTheChipAndTheWayOut` ("the chip label is dimmed") | **caught** |
| The on message says how to turn it off | `spotlightMessage` returns "Spotlight is on." (`internal/app/spotlight_exit.go`) | `TestSpotlightKeyShowsTheChipAndTheWayOut` | **caught** |

## Mode legends in the dock, and messages cut at a word

Hints mode said its keys in a message, and the dock cut it in the middle of a
word: at 80 columns the base build shows `Type a label to copy. Shift+labe…`,
and once the message burnt down the dock showed no keys at all while hints
mode stayed open. Copy mode, multi copy mode and hints mode now show a legend
in the dock, fitted by whole keys. Each control cut one call site from the
current tree in a copy of it, built the binary, and ran the named tests. The
positive half of the fitting control is the 200-column run, which passes on
the broken build because the whole legend fits there. The positive half of the
word-cut control is the 80 and 81 column runs, where a cut by width falls on a
word boundary by chance and passes.

| Fix | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hints mode shows its keys in the dock | the `m.hints != nil` branch in `modeLegend` (`internal/app/mode_legend.go`) | `TestHintsModeLegend` 60x20, 80x24 and 200x50 ("no hints legend on the dock") | **caught** (3 of 3) |
| The legend is fitted by whole keys, and esc stays | `renderModeLegend` draws `overlay.HintStrip` unfitted, so the dock's generic cut ends it | `TestHintsModeLegend/80x24` ("the dock shows "ope", which is not a whole key or label", "the dock does not show esc"), `/60x20` ("the dock lost the key "esc""); `TestCopyModeLegend/60x20` and `/80x24` (no legend with its exit key); both 200x50 runs pass | **caught** |
| A cut message ends on a whole word | `notifFit` back to `strings.TrimRight(truncateToWidth(...), " ")` without `notifWordCut` (`internal/app/render_dock_notification.go`) | `TestCutMessageEndsOnAWholeWord/82x24` ("word 6 of the cut message is "1", want 106"), `/83x24` ("is "10""); 80 and 81 pass | **caught** (2 of 4 widths, as designed) |
| `?` in hints mode shows all of its keys | the `r == '?'` branch in `handleHintsKey` (`internal/input/hints_input.go`) | `TestHintsHelpKeyListsAllKeys` ("? did not open the help on hints mode's keys") | **caught** |

Copy mode also said its keys in a message ("Copy mode (hjkl, q to exit)"),
which held the dock's right end over the legend for twice the message time.
No control is recorded for its removal. The legend tests wait up to the UI
timeout, which is longer than the message lasts, so they pass with it put back.
Five tests waited for that message as the sign that copy mode opened, and now
wait for `y yank` in the legend. Two of them, `TestScrollbackModeShowsEarlierOutput`
and `TestSessionSwitchKeepsScrollback`, were missed at first and failed on
every run of the whole suite until they were changed too.

## Opening links, OSC 8 in the frame, and the URL detector

Each control cut one call site from the current tree, built the binary, and
ran the named test against it. The opener in these tests is a script set
through `appearance.link_opener` that appends its argument to a file, so a
link that opened is a line in that file and a link that was refused is none.
The positive halves are in the same fixtures: the refused file and script
links come before a shift+click that must open, the `link_click = "ctrl"`
test ends with a ctrl+click that must open, and the markdown test copies a
Wikipedia URL that keeps its brackets.

| Fix | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl+click opens a link (shift+click never reaches tuios in most terminals) | whole change: build the tree before it | `TestCtrlClickOpensLinksWithTheirTarget` ("ctrl+click on an OSC 8 label: the opener was started with [], want [https://example.com/real-target]") | **caught** |
| The ctrl+click release opens the link | `handleMouseRelease` in `internal/input/mouse_release.go`: the `CtrlClickLink` branch made unreachable | `TestCtrlClickOpensLinksWithTheirTarget` (same message) | **caught** |
| A focused pane sends its links to the outer terminal as OSC 8 | the cell loop of `renderTerminal`: the link transition made unreachable, which is the old behaviour | `TestCtrlClickOpensLinksWithTheirTarget`: no OSC 8 for the labelled link, the `id=` link, the bare URL and the wrapped bare URL | **caught** (4 of 4 assertions) |
| A logical line with "://" is drawn again with its bare URLs as OSC 8 | the cell loop of `renderTerminal`: `lineHasScheme` never set | `TestCtrlClickOpensLinksWithTheirTarget`: no OSC 8 for the bare URL and the wrapped bare URL. The two marked links pass, which is the positive half | **caught** |

## The session-list poll tick composes no frame

The poll tick stopped composing a frame to save idle CPU. The rail draws
other sessions from the listing the tick's refresh fetches, and that refresh
answered with no message, so a change in another session reached the screen
only when something else drew a frame. The refresh now answers with
`foreignSessionsChangedMsg` when the listing changed. The control is the
tree with the tick change and without that message.

| Fix | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |

## A loaded layout shows its shells (#411)

`TestALoadedLayoutShowsItsShells` saves a layout of three panes and loads it
on an empty workspace of a daemon session.

layout reach the client in a state sync, and before that fix nothing
subscribed a pane that arrived that way.

## Copy path on a folder row (#414)

Each control cut one line, built the binary, and ran
`TestSidebarFolderCopyPath`.

## The scratch group before a daemon restart

`TestScratchGroupSurvivesADaemonRestart` typed into the scratch group as soon
as it pressed the scratch key. The group opens through the daemon, so the
text could reach the pane that had the focus before. The hide then left that
marker on screen, and the test failed (main, run 37025035958). The test now
waits for each pane of the group before it types.

With the waits: passes with the sleep, and 10 of 10 without it | **caught** |

## Back from an empty workspace (discussion #273)

The tests are in `empty_workspace_test.go`. Each control built the binary and
ran the five `TestEmptyWorkspace` tests or the one named.

`TestEmptyWorkspaceStaysWhenTheSettingIsOff` passes on origin/main, because
it holds the old behaviour.

`TestEmptyWorkspaceReturnsAfterXpanesSpeedy` then failed in five main runs in
a row (37232733943 to 37243024125), with two panes left after Enter. The
daemon sent xpanes's `SetMultifocus` to the first client its map gave, which
was the second client about half the time. Multifocus is the client's own, so
Enter at the client that ran xpanes reached one pane. `findTUIClient` now
takes the client the person used last.

## CLI output for scripts, and names that do not exist

The tests are in `cli_scripting_test.go`. One build cut the three checks
below at once. Each assertion reads one of them, so each failure names its
cut.

## The complete keybinds list (#434)

The test is `TestKeybindsListShowsEveryScope` in `keybinds_list_test.go`. One
build made both cuts. Each assertion reads one of them.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The unit test `TestKeybindsListCoversEveryActionAndDefault` in `cmd/tuios`
checks every action and default key on Linux and on macOS. It catches the
same two cuts.

The positive halves are in the same tests: `--types window-created` streams
the event of a new window, and `keep` is still listed after `build` closes.

## Tapes: actions, condition waits, failures and recording

The tests are in `tape_exec_test.go`. Each control is its own build, made by
cutting one call site from the tree the tests were written against.

| SnapFullscreen snaps to a quarter | the tree before the `SnapByDirection` fix | `TestTapeSnapFullscreenFillsTheScreen` (the window is 60x19 of 120x40) | **caught** |

`TestExampleTapeRuns` plays `examples/actions_and_waits.tape` and has no
control of its own: it fails on any of the first two cuts, since the example
uses both.

## herdr plugins

`TestHerdrPluginTrustAndHooks`, `TestHerdrPluginActions`,
`TestHerdrPluginPanes` and `TestHerdrPluginPalette` run the stand-in plugins in
`testdata/herdrplugins`. Each control cut one line in a shared clone of the
branch, built the binary, and ran the one test named.

The trust test carries its positive half in the same fixture: the plugin
that runs nothing while it is off runs its startup and its hook after the
person enables it.

## send-keys in the pane's keyboard mode

`TestSendKeysEncodesKeysForThePaneMode` in `send_keys_encoding_test.go` sends
keys to three panes: one in the kitty keyboard protocol, one in
modifyOtherKeys 2, and one that asked for nothing. The legacy pane is the
positive half: it still gets `ctrl+h` as `08`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

## The opt-in explorers: help -i, config browse, keybinds browse

`explorers_test.go` saves each frame it checks as text and PNG. Each control
cut one call site from the branch, built a binary, and ran the named test.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| help -i does nothing | the help command's `Run`: the `!interactive` term cut, so -i prints the plain help | `TestHelpExplorer` (the child exits 0 before the explorer's title shows) | **caught** |
| help opens an explorer on a terminal | the help command's `Run`: the plain branch also made to need a stdout that is not a terminal | `TestHelpExplorer` (`tuios help` on a terminal never exits by itself) | **caught** |
| config browse does not set | the explorer's `Apply`: the `setConfigOption` call cut | `TestConfigExplorer` (no refusal for `sideways`, and the source never reads `session`) | **caught** |
| keybinds browse is not wired | `addExplorers`: the keybinds `AddCommand` cut | `TestKeybindsExplorer` (the child prints the keybinds help and exits) | **caught** |

The positive halves: each test leaves its explorer with `q`, and
`TestExplorerEscLeaves` with `esc`, and both wait for the process to exit by
itself with status 0. The "plain on a terminal" checks run `tuios help`,
`tuios help checkpoint`, `tuios config`, `tuios list-options`, `tuios keybinds`
and `tuios keybinds list` in a terminal and check that each exits by itself,
never shows the alternate screen, and ends with the lines it prints with no
terminal.
## A close_on_exit window outlived a command that exited at once

`new-window` with `close_on_exit` closes the window from the process's exit
callback, which finds the window by its PTY. A command that exited before
the window was in the state left the callback nothing to find, and the
window stayed. The control is a unit test in `internal/session`, because it
must hold the add until the process has exited, and only a test hook can
order the two. The callback runs in the same fixture, so its finding the
window is the positive half.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

| onExit runs before the window is added | `AddDaemonWindowWith` in `internal/session/session_ops.go`: the `added` gate cut, so onExit runs as the process exits | `TestOnExitSeesTheWindowOfAProcessThatExitedAtOnce` ("onExit ran before the window was in the state") | **caught in `internal/session`** (10 of 10 run) |

## A trim timer reset from outside its synctest bubble

`internal/memtrim` kept one trim timer and reset it on each `Request`. A
window closed inside a synctest bubble armed that timer in the bubble. The
next `Request`, from an ordinary test cleanup, reset it from outside, and the
runtime ended the test binary. Each `Request` now starts its own timer.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## The newest paste buffer lost a tie on mtime

The tmux shim ordered paste buffers by their file's mtime. Two buffers
written in one tick of the kernel's file clock tied, and the name order
picked the top. `paste-buffer` with no `-b` then typed the older buffer.
`writeBuffer` now stamps each buffer after the newest one.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A buffer keeps the mtime the kernel gave it | `internal/tmuxcompat/buffers.go` from origin/main | `TestPasteBufferAcrossCalls` ("the newest buffer typed \"one\\rtwo\\r\", want b2"), 19 of 30 runs. With the fix: 30 of 30 pass | **caught in `internal/tmuxcompat`** |
## tuios hosts sync

`TestHostsSync` syncs four fake hosts: one with no tuios, one with the new
version, one with the old version and a daemon that runs `sleep` in a pane,
and one with no machine behind its address. `TestHostsSyncRestartWithYes`
restarts the daemon of an old host. Each control changed one line, built the
binary, and ran the named test.

| The restart | `planSyncTarget`: `t.restart = true` made `false` | `TestHostsSyncRestartWithYes` (the daemon still runs the old version) | **caught** |
| The busy panes | `readDaemonSessions`: the `parsePaneProcs` call cut | `TestHostsSync` (no busy pane, and the refusal does not name `sleep`) | **caught** |

The first CI run of `TestHostsSync` read the plan right after it made the pane
that runs `sleep`, and found no busy pane (run 37232323815). The pane was not
yet running `sleep`. The test now reads the plan again, for up to 20 seconds,
until the pane shows. The busy-pane control still fails after that wait.

## --start on tuios hosts test and tuios hosts sync

`TestHostsTestStart` tests a fake host that has tuios and no daemon.
`TestHostsSyncStart` tests a fake host with no tuios. `TestHostsSync` also
checks that a restart counts one session as "1 session". Each control ran
the named tests against one build.

## A pending wait-for and a flood of output

`TestWaitForOutputDoesNotSlowFlood` in `internal/session` compared the wall
time of a flood with a pending waiter against one without it. On shared CI
runners that ratio failed at 2.76x and 2.83x (runs 37241456414 and
37246926645), and it was 1.00x to 1.12x locally on one core and on eight.
The load on a runner changes between the two floods, so the ratio measured
the runner. The test now counts what the waiter does during the flood: its
captures, and how long they hold the emulator lock.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A capture on every output event | `waitOutputMinGap` set to 0 in `internal/session/verb_subscribe.go` | `TestWaitForOutputDoesNotSlowFlood` ("the waiter took 1554 captures in 983ms, more than the 26 its gap allows"), 10 of 10 runs | **caught in `internal/session`** |

With the fix the waiter took 7 to 27 captures, and held the lock for 1% to 2%
of the flood on the pure Go backend and 12% on libghostty-vt. 30 of 30 runs
passed on one core, and 5 of 5 with `-tags ghostty`.

## The tape FAILED indicator, looked for after it went away

`TestTapeExecStopsAtTheFailedLine` failed on CI (run 37255241424, shard 3 of
6) with "the client never showed that the tape failed". The client shows
FAILED for `scriptDoneLinger` (2s) after a tape stops, and the first frame
drawn after that drops it. The test slept 2s before it looked, so any frame
drawn in between, such as a notification's, hid the indicator. The test now
looks for FAILED as soon as exec returns, before the sleep.

## The looks pin and a config save in flight

`TestChromeSetFromTheCommandLineRetilesThePanes` failed in CI on 2 and 3
October with "a pane is at row 0 and 38 rows tall" and the rail at column 28.
That is the dock at the bottom row and the rail of the pinned looks. The
harness pins the looks on every CLI call, and the call reads and rewrites the
config file. Before `e57ecf37` a save truncated the file and then wrote it. A
pin that read the empty file wrote back a file of pins alone after the save
ended, and the client's watcher applied it. `e57ecf37` closed the empty read.
The harness now leaves alone a file it has pinned once and that tuios wrote
since, and it writes through a rename. The test also checks the rows after
the rail step, where the rewrite went unseen before.

Both injections below make the two windows wide enough to hit every time. The
product one is on `e57ecf37~1`: `writeConfigBytes` opens the file with
`O_TRUNC`, sleeps, and then writes. The harness one: a pin that reads an empty
file sleeps 1.2 s before it writes. Without them the race did not show
locally: 30 of 30 runs passed on main on 2 cores, and 30 of 30 on
`e57ecf37~1` on 1 core with a busy loop beside it. No CI run of this test
failed after `e57ecf37`. With this change, 30 of 30 runs pass on main on 2
cores.

## What this harness structurally cannot observe

Some things cannot be simulated from here at all. They are listed so that nobody
writes a helper for them, watches it pass, and believes it.

**Pointer motion outside a drag.** `app.ProgramOptions` (internal/app/program_options.go), which every client runs with, installs
`tea.WithFilter(app.FilterMouseMotion)`, a whitelist that discards every
`tea.MouseMotionMsg` unless a window drag, a window resize, an overlay drag, the
scrollback browser, or a pane running a mouse-tracking application is active. In
any other state the model never receives motion, so hover behaviour is not
merely untested here, it is unobservable: a helper that sends motion and an
assertion on its effect would be asserting on an event the shipping binary
throws away. This is why `mouseHover` carries a warning and is used by exactly
one test, `TestBareMotionReachesAnEventTrackingApp`, which drives the one state
where bare motion does get through. Note in particular that as of this commit
`app.ContextMenuHover` is unreachable in the shipping binary for this reason: an
open context menu is not one of the whitelisted states, so moving the pointer
over a menu row cannot highlight it. If the whitelist gains that state, this
paragraph needs revisiting and hover over a menu becomes testable from here.
Motion *is* delivered during `mouseDrag`, because
the press that opens the drag sets `OS.Dragging` before the first motion report
arrives, so the selection, window-move and resize paths are genuinely covered.

**Chords the user's terminal eats first.** The harness writes bytes into a PTY,
so it can only send what a terminal would send. Anything a real terminal
intercepts before the application sees it, shift+click bindings in kitty being
the usual example, cannot be reproduced here, and neither can the *absence* of
those bytes be distinguished from tuios ignoring them. `TestContextMenuTargets`
asserts that tuios acts on a shift+right-click it receives; whether the user's
terminal will deliver one is outside this suite entirely.

**Typing speed.** `SendKeys` writes a whole string in one `write(2)`, so a
command and its Enter arrive as a single burst that bubbletea parses into
back-to-back key events. That is closer to a paste than to typing. Timing-
sensitive input handling, key repeat coalescing and the insert guard's exact
window are covered by unit tests in `internal/input`, not here.

**Races and narrow timing windows.** See the two rows above about the blank
alt-screen cache and the unlocked emulator resize: the program under test is a
separate process, so `-race` on this package instruments the harness and not
tuios.

## Tests without a specific negative control

`TestScrolledOutputRendersCorrectly`, `TestScrollbackModeShowsEarlierOutput`,
and the interactive-surface tests (`TestWindowCreateAndClose`,
`TestRenameWindow`, `TestFocusCycleWithRapidKeyRepeat`, `TestWorkspaceSwitch`,
`TestMinimizeAndRestore`, `TestZoomToggle`, `TestResizeKeepsPaneContent`,
`TestTwoClientsSeeConsistentState`) are not tied to one commit. They cover
surface that had no test at all. They were written to fail loudly rather than
silently: each waits for content a shell computed, so a frozen or blanked UI
fails on the step it broke instead of passing against a stale screen.

Two of them earned their keep during development by failing against the
*fixed* binary for real reasons, which is documented in the commit history:
`countWindows` originally misread the dock, and the tiling assertion originally
waited on a toast that other toasts push off screen.

The frame check in `TestWideRuneInHistorySurvivesANarrowPane` reads the
pane's border cell, and the last column's background in one layout. It
cannot see a style lost at the edge in every layout, because the frame cuts
an overlong row in a way that depends on the render path. The render test in
`internal/app` is the check for that.

## Dock pill caps off (#451)

`dock_pill_caps = false` left the caps on the mode chip and the workspace
pills. Their cap accessors did not read the setting. The default then became
rounded, so an unset option draws the caps.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The whole change | build `origin/main` (`1e0b4c89`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestDockPillCapsFollowTheSetting/off` ("dock_pill_caps = false, and the dock row draws caps", six cap glyphs on the row). The `on` case passes on main, which is correct | **caught** |
| Rounded by default | build `eced6152`, where the default was flat | `TestDockPillCapsFollowTheSetting/default` ("default: the dock row draws only caps [], want caps on the mode chip and the workspace pills"). `off` and `on` pass there, which is correct | **caught** |

## Sessionizer: tuios new --cwd and switch-session (#452)

`tuios new` started the first window in the daemon's directory. No command
switched an attached client, and a session switched to in place ignored
`[startup]`. The tests are in `sessionizer_test.go`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

## Keybindings in a config saved on disk (#358)

`TestAKeybindingSavedOnDiskReachesTheClient` in `config_watch_test.go` binds
`prefix+alt+h` in a saved file and presses it on the running client. The
positive half is in the same test: `prefix+alt+y` from the startup file fires,
and `prefix+alt+h` does nothing before the save.

## Command entries whose made-up names clash

`TestKeybindsDoctorNamesACommandNameClash` in `keybinds_doctor_test.go` writes
two `[[keybindings.command]]` entries with no name, whose commands agree in the
first 40 characters. The positive half is the same two entries with a name
each: the doctor reports nothing and `keybinds list` shows both.

## Compact dock

`dock_compact_test.go` drives `appearance.dock_compact` with the dock at the top
and at the bottom. The positive half is in each fixture: the same test starts
a full dock and asserts the pane's edge on the row after the rule.

| The dock band stays two rows | `InDockBand`: `config.DockFullHeight` in place of `Settings.DockHeight()` | `TestDockCompactPillClickSwitchesWorkspace` top and bottom ("the pane row next to a compact dock: context menu never showed [Split right Rename]").

## Session number keys and the workspace rename action

`TestSwitchSessionByNumberAndRenameWorkspace` in `session_number_keys_test.go`
binds `switch_session_3`, `switch_session_9` and `rename_workspace` with three
sessions. The positive half is in the same test: slot 9 is empty and says so,
and the rename leaves the session the client left alone.

## Tailscale SSH check mode and policy refusals

The tests are in `hosts_tailscale_test.go`. A wrapper in front of the sync
stand-in prints the banner real Tailscale prints in check mode, then waits for
an approval file. A second address prints the policy refusal and exits 255.
The positive half of each test is a host with no gate in the same run, which
syncs or is listed as reached.

## Tailscale SSH sign-in on the rail

The tests are in `hosts_signin_test.go`. The rail stand-in (`writeFakeSSH`)
has the Tailscale wrapper of `hosts_tailscale_test.go` in front of it. The link
opener is a script that records each address it gets. `quickbox` ends each
wait after 6 seconds. The tests wait for its fourth dial to end, so the link's
backoff is 16 seconds: a new page within 8 seconds can only come from the
gesture. After that dial the backoff is 32 seconds, and a page within 12
seconds can only come from the quick redial a sign-in starts. `localbox` and
`lookalikebox` print a banner with `http://127.0.0.1:631/admin` and
`https://login.tailscale.com.evil.example/a/...`.

| A page asked for before the daemon had one never opens | `takePendingSignIns` returns nil, and `applyHostRetry` opens nothing | `TestRailSignInAsksForANewPage/click` and `/enter` (the opener was started with []) | **caught** |

Not covered by an e2e test: the 2 second floor between dials that
`retry-host` can wake (`retryMinGap`), and the address left out of `list-hosts`
and `list-host-sessions` for a caller over a link. The address check itself
also has a table test, `TestSignInURLAllowed` in `internal/federation`.

## Copy sweep after a copy-mode yank

`copy_flash_yank_test.go` samples the frames after a copy-mode yank and holds
the light to the yanked text. `TestCopyFlashSweepsACopyModeYank` covers `y` on
a `v` selection, `y` on a `V` selection through a daemon, and a copy-pipe key.
`TestCopyFlashSweepsAMultiCopyYank` covers `y` in multi copy mode. The positive
half is the mouse copy in `copy_flash_test.go`, which sweeps with the same
config, and the multi copy test also asserts no light on the pane without a
selection.

## last_pane

`last_pane_test.go` walks the focus with the focus-window CLI, presses `;` to
flip back and forth, then repeats the flip after a new pane (`n`) and after a
switch to an empty workspace (`Alt+2`, `n`), where the flip must return to the
pane focus left on workspace one.

The new-pane and workspace cases sit downstream of the first flip and never ran | **caught** |
## Resizing under shared borders

`shared_border_resize_test.go` resizes panes with shared borders on and reads
both the rectangles from `list-windows` and the divider cells from the frame.
Each test asserts that the resize moved something before it asserts the
divider survived, so a fixture that resizes nothing cannot pass.

## Pane labels (display_panes)

The tests are in `pane_labels_test.go`. They read each label's block glyphs
off the screen with the pane's name under them, type the label, and read the
focused pane back from list-windows. The positive half of each jump is a
check that the focus was on another pane before the label was typed. Esc
closes the labels with no jump in the same test. The leak test sets one known
prompt in every pane and shows first, with the labels closed, that the key
and the paste reach the shells and leave the line it looks for.

## ssh-aware splits

The tests are in `ssh_split_test.go`. A fake ssh on PATH writes its arguments
to a numbered file and then acts as a shell. `TestSSHSplitRunsTheSSHOnPath`
uses a compiled stand-in (`fakessh/`) on PATH and a copy of it in the pane's
folder, run as `./ssh`. The refusal tests (`TestSSHSplitRefusesAProxyCommand`,
`TestSSHSplitIgnoresTheSSHOfATransfer`) have their positive half in
`TestSSHSplitRunsTheSameSSH` and `TestSSHSplitFindsSSHUnderANestedShell`,
which follow ssh through the same fixture. The stand-in answers `ssh -G` with
the host name of `-o HostName`, or the destination, and records nothing.
`TestSSHSplitPassesTheAgentSocket` starts an `ssh-agent` in the pane and
stops it when it ends. The positive half of the follow
option is in its own fixture: the same split key in a pane with no ssh opens a
shell. `TestSSHSplitFallsBackToAShell` is the positive half of every other
test: the actions open a pane when no ssh runs.

## The pane navigator (choose_tree) and list-windows --all

The tests are in `navigator_test.go`. The target pane prints its marker in
two halves, so only its screen text holds the marker whole. The positive half
of the jump is a check that the focus was on another pane first, and Esc
closes the navigator with no switch in the same test. The grant test runs the
same listing from outside every pane first, where it must hold the other
session's text.

### Review fixes for the navigator

`TestNavigatorTakesPastes` sets one known prompt in the shell and shows
first, with the navigator closed, that a paste reaches it. The stale-load,
cap and deadline tests use two seams: `TUIOS_E2E_HOLD_NAV` holds a load
until a file goes, and `TUIOS_E2E_NAV_CAPTURES` lowers the cap to one pane.
The verb client tests are unit tests of the deterministic race kind, in
`internal/session/verb_client_step_test.go`. The listing test is a unit test
of the security boundary kind, in `cmd/tuios/list_every_pane_test.go`.

### A scattered name outranks the screen text

`TestNavigatorLooks` failed in CI when a pane's id and its `t.TempDir`
folder spelled `needle-7781` out of order. Every field hit outranked every
text hit, so that pane took the cursor and the preview from logs. Now both
kinds of hit rank by the same fuzzy score. `TestNavigatorRanksScreenTextOverAScatteredName`
names a pane `need a ledge-77 81` so the case is fixed, not random. Its
positive half is in the same wait: the decoy is listed, so the search matched
it and only the order decides. The control was also run on the pre-fix
build, with the same failure.

| A field hit outranks every text hit | `navigatorSearchRows`: the field hit's score given a lead of `1<<21` | `TestNavigatorRanksScreenTextOverAScatteredName` ("the search for needle-7781 did not put the cursor and the preview on logs") | **caught** |

`TestNavigatorScoresTheWholeOccurrence` prints `navDecoy` and then the marker
on one line. `Find` aligns the query inside the shortest window that ends
first, so it scores the spread copy, which ties the decoy's name, and the
decoy wins the tie. The control frame lists late under the decoy.

### The navigator's look

The tests are in `navigator_preview_test.go`. `TestNavigatorLooks`, in
`navigator_look_test.go`, saves the frames a person looks at and asserts only
that each screen showed. The colour test reads the ink of the marker inside
the preview box only, so the coloured search line and list row cannot pass it.
No theme is on, so the pane's red and green reach the host as palette slots 1
and 2, which the chrome does not use. The inert test reads every byte tuios
wrote to the host, from the start, after the preview shows the pane's text.
`TestNavParseStyledPassesOnlySGR` is a unit test of the security boundary
kind, for what a daemon that is not tuios could send.

## Agents settings tab and the integration notice

`agents_settings_test.go` uses a temporary home with a Claude Code integration
aged from the current version to the one before, and a stand-in `claude` on
PATH. The positive halves are in the same fixtures: the same frame shows Codex
as not installed, the daemon's `list-agents` is read for the harness on both
panes before the "no second toast" half counts, and
`TestAgentsSettingsTabBeforeTape` is the switch-on twin of
`TestAgentsSettingsHiddenWithAgentsOff`.

### Review fixes

`TestAgentsSettingsKeepsTheCommandPath` installs with `--command` and the full
path of the binary under test, current and aged.
`TestAgentsSettingsAbsentOverSSH` attaches through `tuios ssh` to the same
fixture. Its positive halves are `TestAgentsSettingsTabBeforeTape` (the menu
line and the tab) and `TestAgentsIntegrationNoticeOncePerRun` (the palette),
with a local client. The notice test now also starts a second client before
the dismissal, which shows the toast, and a third after it, which does not.
The race tests in `internal/integration/file_changed_test.go` change the file
just before the last check, through a test hook.

### Second review

`TestAgentsNoticeOutlastsAnEsc` presses esc in terminal mode once the toast
shows, checks that nothing was stored, and attaches again: the toast comes
back. It is also the positive half of the stored dismissal, which
`TestAgentsIntegrationNoticeOncePerRun` now makes with a click on the dismiss
end of the toast. `TestInstallNamesWhatAPartialWriteChanged` changes Hermes's
`config.yaml`, the last of its three files, before each rename.

server or the status line left, and the doctor's note for a session whose
hosts it could not read.

## A new session on a host ignores startup.tiled (#480)

`TestRemoteCreateAppliesStartup` in `sessionizer_test.go` uses the second
daemon and the ssh stand-in of the host tests. This client has `[startup]
tiled = true`. The host has no config, so the tiling comes from the config of
the client. From a tiled session, `switch-session --create build:far-new` must
make a tiled session on the host. `tuios new --host build far-fresh` is checked
in the same fixture. It already passed on main, so it is the positive half: the
host and the check of the tiling work.

`TestSwitchToAnEmptySessionTakesItsLayout` in the same file checks the layout
mode. `blank` is master-stack and empty, and `home` is BSP. The client goes
from `home` to `blank` and switches workspace there, which sends its layout to
the daemon. `blank` must stay master-stack. Its positive half is `home`: the
same client reports BSP there.

## A popup that switches the session (#479)

`TestPopupThatSwitchesSessionCloses` in `popup_test.go` opens a popup whose
command runs `tuios switch-session --create away` and exits. The popup must
leave the window list of `home`, where no client is attached when it exits.
Its positive half is in the same fixture: a popup that exits without a switch
leaves the list too.

`TestPopupWaitAfterTheDaemonClosedIt` in `internal/session/popup_wait_test.go`
is a race regression for the close. The daemon closes the popup, and with it
the PTY, when the command exits. `popup --wait` must still return the exit
status. A test-only hook, `popupBeforeWaitHook`, holds the wait until the PTY
is gone, so the order is the same on every run.

## A session's start directory across a restart (#478)

`TestRestoredSessionKeepsItsStartDirectory` makes a session with
`tuios new --cwd`, runs `tuios kill-server`, waits for the new daemon to
restore the session, and opens a window on an empty workspace with
`tuios new-window --workspace 3`. Inheritance is off in the config, and the
only pane moves out of the project first, so the start directory is the only
way the window can land in the project. The daemon runs in `base/cwd`.

### Review fixes

`TestStartDirectoryOutlivesARestartWhileMissing` moves the project folder
away, restarts the daemon (the restore runs with the folder gone), restarts it
again (`kill-server` saves the session first), moves the folder back, restarts
a third time, and opens a window on an empty workspace.

Not covered end to end: `absStartDir` on the create paths. The CLI sends an
absolute folder already, so only a raw verb call can send a relative one.

## A pane on a switch to an empty workspace (#477)

`new_window_when_empty_test.go` turns on `workspaces.new_window_when_empty`.
`TestEmptyWorkspaceOpensAPane` checks that startup opens no pane, then
switches by key to workspace 2 (one pane, in the folder of the pane it came
from), exits that pane and switches to workspace 5 (one pane, in the
session's start folder), presses `move_and_follow_7` (workspace 7 holds only
the moved pane), runs `tuios xpanes` (its workspace holds two panes), and
switches with `run-command SwitchWorkspace` and `select-workspace` (no pane).
Inheritance is off, so the folder has one way to be chosen.
`TestEmptyWorkspaceOpensOnePaneForTwoClients` switches one of two attached
clients and counts one pane. `TestEmptyWorkspacePaneSettingReloads` switches
with the setting off (no pane), turns it on in the file and switches again
(one pane). Every count waits until the client that took the keys reports
no pane request in flight (`run-command GetSessionInfo`, `pane_requests`), then
counts again. A request clears when a sync brings its pane, so the daemon has
made every pane the client asked for. The two client test asks each client.

Not covered end to end: a client attached to a session on another machine,
a session without a daemon (the pane starts in the folder of the source
pane's shell, read by this client), and the settings page row.

### Review fixes: fast switches

`TestEmptyWorkspaceFastSwitches` sends Alt+2 Alt+1, then Alt+2 Alt+1 Alt+2,
then Alt+2 Alt+3, each as one write. `TUIOS_E2E_HOLD_PANE` makes the daemon
hold each pane request for a second, so the pushes the later keys make queue
behind it. Once no request is in flight it checks the workspace the session
and the client show (1, 2, 3) and the panes on each workspace (one each).

| The build before the review | `fe57ce01` | none: it has no `TUIOS_E2E_HOLD_PANE`, so its daemon answers before the next key, and it has no `pane_requests` | **not caught** |

Not covered end to end: the version check (`EmptyWorkspacePanes` in the
welcome) against a daemon from before this change, and a switch from a

### Second review: one pane per workspace at the daemon

`TUIOS_E2E_HOLD_PANE` now acts only with `TUIOS_E2E=1`, and a file that holds
`refuse` makes the daemon fail the request.
`TestEmptyWorkspaceSlowRequestOpensOnePane` holds the first request for 7 s,
waits 5.5 s, and sends Alt+1 Alt+2, so the client asks again after its 5 s
timeout. `TestEmptyWorkspaceTwoClientsSwitchAtOnce` holds requests for 2 s:
the first client switches to 2, and the second follows, then sends Alt+1
Alt+2, so both clients ask. `TestEmptyWorkspaceFailedRequestKeepsTheSwitch`
refuses the request for Alt+2, presses Alt+1, and waits for the session to
show workspace 1 with no pane on 2. `TestEmptyWorkspacePaneFollowsSSH` turns
on `appearance.new_window_follow_ssh`, runs the fake ssh in the pane on 1,
and switches to 2: the new pane runs the same ssh.

## A session made from the session switcher ignores [startup] tiled (#488)

`[startup] tiled = true`, opens the session switcher, types `fresh`, a name
no session has, and presses Enter. `fresh` must be tiled, and its first
window must fill the session. The same client then runs the palette's
"New session", which came up tiled on main too: it is the positive half.

## Workspace label cap and tab format

`dock_workspace_label_max_test.go` drives the dock's workspace pill through
`appearance.dock_workspace_label_max` and `appearance.dock_workspace_tab_format`

## A new window ignores the OSC 7 folder on Windows (#491)

`TestNewWindowInheritsTheOSC7Folder` in `inherit_cwd_osc7_test.go` starts the
daemon with `TUIOS_E2E=1` and `TUIOS_E2E_NO_PROCESS_CWD=1`, which makes every
process read fail, as it does on Windows, and with
`COMPUTERNAME=TUIOS-E2E-PC`. The pane's shell is `/bin/sh`, which reports
nothing, and the test prints each report. The session starts in
`base/start`. From the focused pane each time:

- an OSC 7 report with this machine's host name in capitals: the new window
  must start there. This is the positive half, and main with the hook passes
  it.
- an OSC 7 report with the host `TUIOS-E2E-PC`: the new window must start
  there.
- an OSC 7 report of a folder that does not exist: the new window must start
  in `base/start`.
- an OSC 9;9 report with a quoted path: the new window must start there.

`TestNewWindowPrefersTheShellsProcessFolder` is the review's regression,
with process reads on. A program in a `/bin/sh` pane prints OSC 7 for
`base/fake`, which exists, and the person then runs `cd base/real`. The new
window must start in `base/real`. The daemon holding the report is the
positive half.

review's case: the record, which holds the pane's report, is taken only when
no process can be read. A shell whose folder was deleted is readable, and
then the window gets the start folder, not the report.

### The slash in front of the drive (#491, second report)

The reporter's `list-windows` showed the folder `\C:\dev\x` for the report
`file://NOTE238/C:/dev/x`: the URL path keeps a slash in front of the drive.
`winpath.FileURL` is now the one reader of an OSC 7 URL, on the client and in
the daemon, and it drops that slash. `winpath.ForOS` turns the folder into a
path for the daemon's OS, and refuses a drive path on any OS but Windows.

`TestParseCwdOnEachOS` in `internal/session/session_place_test.go` runs the
parser for a Windows daemon and for a Linux one on any OS: the reporter's URL,
`file:///C:/x`, percent escapes, OSC 9;9 in both slashes and quoted, UNC paths,
and reports from another machine. It also passes as a Windows binary under
wine. A UNC report, `file://server/share/x`, is read as the folder `/share/x`
on the machine `server`, because OSC 7 names the machine the shell runs on.

`TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder` in `ssh_split_test.go` is the
case Linux can show: the far shell reports `file://fakehost/C:/Users/pollen/my%20app`,
and an ssh split must run plain ssh. Before, it ran `cd "/C:/Users/pollen/my app"`
through `sh`, which a Windows ssh server does not have.
`TestSSHSplitKeepsTheRemoteFolder` is the positive half: a POSIX folder from
the same far machine still gets its `cd`.

| The drive slash stays in the URL path | `dropDriveSlash`: `return p[1:]` made `return p` | `TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder` (ssh ran `cd "/C:/Users/pollen/my app"`), `TestParseCwdOnEachOS` (the far-machine rows read `/C:/dev/x`, and Linux takes `file:///C:/x` as a local folder) | **caught** |
| No drive slash is dropped anywhere, as in v0.8.5 | the same, and `FromPOSIX` no longer trims the slash before its drive check | `TestParseCwdOnEachOS` (every Windows row with a drive: the reporter's URL is refused, want `C:\dev\tuios_0.8.5_Windows_x86_64`) | **caught** |
| A UNC folder gets a cd | `safeRemoteDir`: the `//` refusal cut | `TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder/unc` (ssh ran `cd "//srv/share"`) | **caught** |

The review's second round added three things. `safeRemoteDir` refuses a
folder that starts with `//`, which is the UNC folder of a Windows shell
(`file://winbox//srv/share`), and the `unc` row of
`TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder` covers it. `FileURL` refuses a
path that decodes to a control character (`%00`, `%1b`, `%0a`), and
`TestParseCwdOnEachOS` has rows for those and a positive row for `%C3%A9`.
`hintCwdHost` reads the host with `url.Parse` again, so a report with no
path, `file://far`, still names another machine and still blocks opening a
path here.

Not covered end to end: a real Windows machine. The unit table and the wine run
stand in for it.

## A bare attach picks the session the person used last (#486)

A bare `tuios attach` lands on the session the person used last: the
latest `lastUsed`, then the latest activity. Only `MsgSessionUsed` sets
`lastUsed`. A client sends it for input from the terminal it runs in, at most
once a second per session, and only to a daemon whose welcome set
`SessionUsed`. The daemon takes it only from a client that may act as the
person. Pane input (`MsgInput`) is activity only: a routed `send-keys`, a
tape and a focus report reach the pane that way too. The client reports
input before it handles it, so after a key or a click that switches sessions
it reports once more for the session moved to. `lastUsed` is saved with the
session, at the latest 30 seconds after a use, and restored.

The tests are in `attach_most_recent_test.go`. A client that must not count
as the person is started with no key pressed: `attachIn` presses Alt+Esc,
which is the person using the session.

- `TestBareAttachLandsOnTheSessionTypedInLast` makes four sessions. Each of
  five rounds attaches a client to one session by name and uses it, then a
  bare attach must land there. Rounds 1, 3 and 5 type a command into the
  pane. Rounds 2 and 4 press Alt and a number in window mode.
- `TestBareAttachIgnoresAgentWindowsAndRoutedCommands` has a client sit on
  `watched`. The person types in `person`. Then windows open in `agent`
  from the CLI and `select-workspace` is routed to the client on `watched`.
  A bare attach must land on `person`. The positive half comes first:
  before any typing, the agent's windows make `agent` the pick.
- `TestBareAttachIgnoresKeysSentToATerminalModeClient` is the second
  review's case. A client sits on `watched` in terminal mode. The person
  types in `person`, then `tuios send-keys -s watched` types a command, which
  runs in the pane there. A bare attach must land on `person`.
- `TestBareAttachFollowsASwitchFromTheSessionBrowser` is the third review's
  case. The person attaches to `first`, switches to `second` in the session
  browser, reads it with no key, and detaches. A bare attach must land on
  `second`. Every key the person pressed was used in `first`, which is the
  positive half.
- `TestBareAttachAfterARestartLandsOnTheSessionTypedInLast` types in `alpha`
  of `alpha`, `beta` and `gamma`, runs `kill-server`, and a bare attach that
  starts the daemon again must land on `alpha`.

The fixed build passed three runs in a row.

Not covered end to end: the save mark in `TouchUsed`, since the attach that
precedes the typing already marks the session for a save, a crash, a client
inside a pane, and a mix of an old client with a new daemon.

## A pane reports a pixel size of zero (#506)

A Textual app quit with `ZeroDivisionError` when the mouse entered its pane.
Textual turns on in-band resize reports (mode 2048) and then SGR-pixel mouse
reports (mode 1016). It takes pixels per cell from the 2048 report and divides
each mouse report by it. The pure Go emulator sent `0;0` for the pixels in
every 2048 report. libghostty-vt sent no 2048 report and no XTWINOPS 14, 16 or
18 answer, because tuios never gave it the size callback. A pane that no
client had measured, such as a detached session's, also had a TIOCGWINSZ pixel
size of zero.

The fix takes every pixel size from one cell: the host's, or the fallback cell
in `internal/cellsize` (10x20) before a client reports one. The 2048 report,
XTWINOPS 14 and 16, the pty's winsize from its spawn on, and the 1016 mouse
reports all use it. A guest with 2048 on gets a new report when the cell size
changes.

The guest in `pixel_size_test.go` reads TIOCGWINSZ, the 2048 report and
XTWINOPS 14 and 16, and prints each SGR-pixel mouse report.
`TestPaneReportsItsPixelSize` runs it in a standalone and a daemon session
with an 8x16 host cell. Every size must match that cell, and two hovers one
cell apart must be reported 8 pixels apart. `TestDetachedPaneReportsAPixelSize`
runs it in a detached session: the sizes must match the fallback cell. A
client with an 8x16 cell then attaches, and the guest's last 2048 report must
be in 8x16 cells. A real Textual 8.2.8 app, run the same way, quit with the
reported traceback on main and mapped six hovers to six consecutive cells with
the fix, on both backends. That run is not in the suite, because CI has no
Textual.

| A new cell size is not sent to a 2048 guest | `Emulator.SetCellSize`: the report cut | none end to end: the attach also resizes the pane, and that report carries the new cell. `TestConform_PixelSizeReports` in `internal/vt` catches it | **unit only** |

`TestGhosttyDiffPixelSizeReports` (`-tags ghostty`) compares the two backends'
answers to 14, 16, 18 and 2048, with and without a host cell, and after a new
cell size.

Not covered end to end: macOS, a host that reports its cell size itself
rather than through `TUIOS_CELL_SIZE`, and a resize of a detached pane, which
goes through the winsize fallback.

### Review fixes: one client's cell, and no repeated reports

The pane's cell flipped between clients with different fonts: each client set
it on its own attach and its own pane resizes. It is now one client's cell
(`sessionCellSize`). Under `window_size = latest` that is the latest client,
which owns the session's size. Under smallest and largest, no client owns the
size, so it is the client that attached first. A client that reported no cell
is skipped. Every change to who is attached, and to who owns the size, goes
through `recalculateAndBroadcastSize`, which now gives every pane that cell.

`TestPaneCellFollowsOneClient` starts the guest in a detached session with the
fallback cell. Client a attaches with an 8x16 cell and client b with 12x24.
Every 2048 report the guest gets must stay in a's cell. When a leaves, the cell
must move to b's, which is the positive half.

The ghostty backend now ignores the same cell set twice. The library sends a
2048 report on every resize, and the daemon sets the cell on every pane resize
and every attach. `Emulator.SetCellSize` ignores a zero cell, as the ghostty
backend does. `TestPaneReportsItsPixelSize` also checks the absolute x of the
first hover: the centre of the pane cell under it, from the pane's first
column on the screen.

The 2048 reports are not held back during a drag with the winsize hold. The
pure emulator sends its report when it applies the resize in the output
stream, and libghostty sends its own from inside its resize. Holding them back
needs a hold in both backends.

## The rail's terminals header runs into the peeked name

While the pointer peeks a session row, the terminals header names that session
on its right, in front of the add control. The name was sized from half the
rail, which ignored the label. On a narrow rail the header read
"terminalssession-1", and at some widths the add control moved one cell off its
spine. `sidebarHeaderRow` now keeps two blank cells (`sidebarHeaderGap`) after
every header label and cuts the right element from its front. The terminals
header sizes the name from the room the row really has, and shows no name when
fewer than three cells are left. The add, cd and agents controls refuse to draw
closer than the same gap.

`TestRailHeaderKeepsAGapBeforeThePeekedName` peeks a session with a long name
at rail widths 16, 18, 20 and 24. It checks the gap after "terminals", that the
header names the session at 20 and up (the positive half), that the add control
is on its spine, and that a click on it makes a pane.

Width 16 passes the two narrow controls because no name fits there. The first
