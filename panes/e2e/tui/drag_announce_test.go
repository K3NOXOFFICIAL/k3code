// Dragging a tiled pane about must not resize the shell inside it.
//
// A drag is a gesture, and the sizes it passes through on the way are not sizes
// the guest was ever meant to live at: a borderless pane gives its shared-border
// allowance up on the first motion, and the retile on the drop gives it back. In
// a tiled layout the pane usually lands in a slot the same size as the one it
// left, so both of those were avoidable, and each of them is a SIGWINCH that a
// shell answers by repainting its prompt. Rearranging two panes left a new line
// in each of them.
//
// The pane counts the signals itself: its shell prints one marker line per
// SIGWINCH, so the assertion is on rows in the grid, which is exactly the
// symptom. The marker is spelled with a runtime substitution so the echoed
// command line does not contain the string being counted.

// dragAnnouncePanes builds three tiled borderless panes on a daemon session and
// arms a SIGWINCH counter in the last one. Tiling puts the first on the left at
// full height and splits the right-hand half between the other two, so the
// armed pane has a same-size neighbour under it and a different-size one beside
// it, which is what the two tests below need.
