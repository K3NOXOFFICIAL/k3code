// The report this file exists for: with a split open and a browser attached
// beside the terminal, switching panes made the session resize itself, settle
// back on the old ratio, and take a line of scrollback with it each time.
//
// The cause is that a pane's rectangle was synced as an absolute number while
// the box it was measured in was worked out privately by each client, out of
// that client's own chrome. Two clients with different chrome therefore
// partitioned different boxes and each dragged the shared PTYs to its own
// answer, twice per push. Chrome that differs is ordinary: the sidebar is a
// rail one client can have and another can be running without.
//
// Asserted on the grid rather than on the model, because the whole failure was
// the two disagreeing.

// isPaneCorner reports whether a rune is a pane's top-left corner. The corner
// is what makes this measurable: a rail and a pane both draw a vertical rule,
// and on the client that has a rail the two stand in adjacent columns, so
// nothing that counts rules can tell them apart. Only a pane draws a corner.

// TestOneClientsRailDoesNotMoveAnotherClientsPanes is the agreement the report
// is about, on the grid.
//
// Two clients on one session, the same size, and one of them turns its sidebar
// on. The rail is chrome and chrome belongs to the client that draws it, so the
// panes have to end up in the same columns on both screens: a pane's box is
// shared, because the shells inside it are. The client without a rail leaves
// the band blank rather than filling it, and switching between panes moves
// nothing.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: none. This is a deliberate passes-both-ways control, and
// saying so is the point of writing it down.
//
// It was written expecting to fail on the unfixed tree and does not, and the
// reason is worth keeping: on the unfixed tree the two clients reach the same
// frame anyway, by fighting to it. The client with the rail reads the other's
// rectangles as a layout for somebody else's screen, works out its own and
// pushes it; the client without one reads what comes back as settled, because a
// layout that sits inside a wider box and still reaches its far edges is
// indistinguishable from one that belongs there. So the wider client always
// yields and the frames converge, after both have dragged the shared PTYs to
// their own answer and back. The cost is real and it is not on the grid: it is
// a pair of resizes per push, one of them narrowing, which is what damages
// scrollback under a reflowing emulator.
//
// The tests that failed on the unfixed tree therefore counted resizes rather
// than read frames. They were internal/app unit tests and have been removed;
// TestSessionHoldsOneSizeForTwoClients and
// TestGeometryConfigDisagreementDoesNotMovePanes here, and the convergence
// harness in internal/app (TestMultiClientConvergence), now cover two clients
// agreeing on pane sizes. What this one is for is the property a resize count
// cannot see: that what the two people are looking at is the same layout. It
// would catch a change that settled the resizes by letting the two frames
// drift apart.
