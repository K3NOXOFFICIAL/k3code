// TestInboxThatFillsAfterOpeningIsCentred opens the Inbox with nothing in it,
// then a risky approval arrives and fills it with the list, the detail and the
// footer. The panel keeps its first top while it fits, so it does not
// jump at every small change. It used to keep that top however much it grew,
// which left the filled Inbox on the bottom edge with half the screen empty
// above it. A panel whose centre moves more than a few rows is centred again.
// The frame is saved under artifactDir.
//
// How this could pass wrongly, written down first:
//   - The item could already be in the Inbox when it opens, and then the
//     first frame is the tall one and nothing is tested. The empty state is
//     waited for before the approval is made.
//   - The panel's edges are read from its title and its last footer line,
//     so the check fails if either is missing rather than measuring nothing.
//   - A panel that changes by a row or two keeps its top by design, so the
//     change has to be the whole list arriving: the empty panel is about ten
//     rows tall and the filled one about twenty-seven.
//
// Negative control: with overlayAnchorY returning the held top whenever the
// screen height is the same, the check fails with 13 rows above the panel and
// 1 below.
