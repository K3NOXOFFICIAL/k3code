// Clicking a pane to focus it must not resize the shell inside it.
//
// With shared borders on, a tiled pane is borderless and the whole rectangle
// belongs to the guest. The drag setup took that allowance away on the press,
// which is two rows and two columns of real estate, and the retile on release
// gave it back. Each of those is a SIGWINCH, and a shell repaints its prompt on
// a SIGWINCH, so picking a pane with the mouse left a new line in it. The end
// state is identical either way, which is why this counts what the pane
// received rather than comparing sizes afterwards.
//
// The pane counts the signals itself: its shell prints one marker line per
// SIGWINCH, so the assertion is on rows in the grid, which is exactly the
// symptom. The marker is spelled with a runtime substitution so the echoed
// command line does not contain the string being counted.
//
// appearance.click_to_type is "double" because that is the policy that leaves a
// single click in window-management mode, which is where the drag setup runs.
// It is the maintainer's own setting and the one the report came from.

// clickFocusPanes builds two tiled borderless panes on a daemon session and
// arms a SIGWINCH counter in the second one, which tiling puts on the right.
